  abstract = {Nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from agricultural soils are influenced by several factors, including fertilizer and water management. A 4-year study (2012–15) was conducted to evaluate the impact of different types of fertilizer and water table management systems on N2O emissions under a corn-soybean rotation. The types of fertilizers assessed were inorganic fertilizer (IF) and a combination of inorganic fertilizer and solid cattle manure (SCM) (applied in 2012 and 2014, for corn only), while the water table management systems were regular tile drainage (DR), and controlled drainage with sub-irrigation (CDS). The IF and SCM were combined with DR and CDS in separate plots arranged as a two by two factorial design. The results show that, in 2012, 2013 and 2014, N2O fluxes were significantly (2012, 2013 p {$<$} 0.05; 2014 p {$<$} 0.1) affected by the fertilizer treatments. In 2012 and 2014, when fertilizer was applied to corn, the emissions were greater from IF than SCM; however, in 2013, under soybean cultivation, the emissions were greater from SCM than IF, indicating slow mineralization of SCM fertilizer compared to IF. In 2014, under corn and 2015 under soybean, the N2O fluxes were significantly higher (P {$<$} 0.05) from DR compared to CDS plots indicating a greater reduction of N2O to dinitrogen (N2) via denitrification. The results also showed that early in the growing season, high N2O fluxes were observed following planting due to fertilizer application, precipitation in excess of 100 mm per month in the early growing season, and spring tillage. The N emission factors of IF-DR, IF-CDS, SCM-DR, and SCM-CDS were 1.2, 0.9, 1.0, and 0.5, respectively. This study concludes that the combination of SCM and CDS is the most efficient at reducing N2O emissions while maintaining sustainable yields in a corn-soybean rotation.},

  abstract = {The connection between litter chemistry and the pathways controlling soil organic matter (SOM) formation and decay in forest ecosystems remains poorly understood, particularly in tropical soils. We addressed this question by incubating samples of a Ferralsol for 200 days with typical forest litter (leaves, twigs, bark, and roots) ob­ tained from 13C-enriched Eucalyptus seedlings. Throughout the incubation, we monitored 13C/12C–CO2 evolved from the soil to quantify the microbial respiration of the 13C-labeled fresh plant litter and of the native SOM. Afterwards, we used density fractionation to obtain particulate organic matter (POM) with density {$<$}1.8 g cm− 3, and the soil material remaining was wet-sieved to obtain SOM with particle-size {$>$}53 μm and mineral-associated SOM (MAOM, with particle-size {$<$}53 μm). We used solid-state 13C-CPMAS-NMR spectroscopy to assess the molecular composition of plant material and SOM fractions and quantified microbial amino sugars in bulk soil using gas chromatography. Our 13C/12C–CO2 results indicate that leaves, twigs, and bark (aboveground litter) were respired at higher rates but led to lower degradation of native SOM as compared to root tissues. On average, aboveground litter promoted net C gains in both POM and MAOM, whereas root litter only led to net C gains in POM. Overall, SOM formation via microbial incorporation of aboveground litter through in vivo pathways ap­ pears to be more efficient and causes less degradation of native MAOM than roots. Moreover, a reduction in microbial amino sugars in bulk soils suggests that in vivo pathways also favored the formation of POM, which had more microbial-derived protein than forest litter. Therefore, the connection between litter chemistry and the pathways controlling SOM formation in tropical forest ecosystems must be included in a framework that also considers the mineralization of native SOM and the vertical separation of aboveground and belowground C inputs to soils.},

Due to the model’s simplicity, the differential equations were solved analytically, and parameter optimizations can be made using generally available nonlinear regression programs. The calibration parameter values were derived from a 35-yr experiment with arable crops on a clay soil in central Sweden. We show how the model can be used for mediumterm (30 yr) predictions of the effects of changed inputs, climate, initial pools, litter quality, etc., on soil carbon pools. Equations are provided for calculating steady-state pool sizes as well as model parameters from litter bag or 14C-labeled litter decomposition data. Strategies for model parameterization to different inputs, climatic regions, and soils, as well as the model’s relations to other model families, are briefly discussed.},

  abstract = {Swedish arable land covers 3 Mha and its topsoil contains about 300 Mton C. The mineral soils seem to be close to steady-state, but the organic soils ͑about 10\% of total arable land͒ have been estimated to lose ca. 1 Mton/ year. We have devised a conceptual model ͑ICBMregion͒, using national agricultural crop yield/manuring statistics and allometric functions to calculate annual C input to the soil together with a five-parameter soil carbon model ͑ICBMr͒, calibrated using long-term field data. In Sweden, annual yield statistics are reported for different crops, for each of eight agricultural regions. Present topsoil carbon content and regional distribution of soil types have recently been measured. We use daily weather station data for each region together with crop type ͑bulked from individual crop data͒ and soil type to calculate an annual soil climate parameter for each crop/soil type permutation in each region. We use 14 soil types and 9 crop types, which gives 126 parameter sets for each year and region, each representing a fraction of the region’s area. For each year, region, crop and soil type, ICBMregion calculates the change in young and old soil carbon per hectare, and sums up the changes to, e.g., national changes. With eight regions, we will have 1008 parameter sets per year, which easily can be handled, and what-if scenarios as well as comparisons between benchmark years are readily made. We will use the model to compare the soil C pools between the IPCC benchmark year 1990 and the present. In principle, we use inverse modelling from the sampled, recent soil C pools to estimate those in 1990. In the calculations, soil climate and yield for each year from 1990 onwards are taken into account. Then we can project soil C balances into the future under different scenarios, e.g., business as usual, land use change or changes in agricultural crops or cultivation practices. Projections of regional climate change are also available, so we can quite easily make projections of soil C dynamics under, e.g., different climate scenarios. We can follow the dynamic effects of carbon sequestration efforts – and estimate their efficiency. The approach is conceptually simple, fairly complete, and can easily be adapted to different needs and availability of data. However, perhaps the greatest advantage is that the results from this comprehensive approach used for, e.g., a 10-year period, can be condensed into a very simple spreadsheet model for calculating effects of management/land use changes on C stocks in agricultural soils.},

  abstract = {Applying pig slurry (PS) on agricultural soils is a common practice. However, its impact on soil organic C dynamics is not clear. This experiment investigated the use of natural 13C abundance to study the short-term C mineralization of anaerobically stored PS under field conditions. Measurements of d13C–CO2 were made on soil air samples obtained from a bare sandy loam during 22 d following incorporation of either PS alone, PS+barley straw, or barley straw alone; an unamended treatment was used as a control. Slurry C was enriched in 13C (À20.0\%) because of the high corn (Zea mays L.) content of the animal diet. This value contrasted with d13C of À28.4\% for the soil organic matter and of À29.0\% for the barley straw. A peak of high d13CO2 values (average of À9.2\%) was observed on the day of PS application and was attributed to the dissociation of PS carbonates when mixed with the relatively acidic soil. After this initial burst, 36\% of the evolved CO2 originated from the decomposing PS. After 22 d of incubation, approx. 20\% of the PS-C had been lost as CO2. This short-term field study did not show any priming effect of PS on the mineralization of straw or native soil C. Due to its heterogeneity, the use of the isotopic composition of the evolved CO2 for estimating PS decomposition requires precaution either through the use of a specific experimental design involving comparable C3 and C4 treatments, or calculations to account for the presence of 13C-enriched inorganic C in the PS.},

  abstract = {Soil organic matter (SOM) represents a major reservoir of stored carbon (C). However, uncertainties regarding the composition and origin of stabilized SOM hinder the implementation of sustainable management strategies. Here, we synthesize data on the contribution of plant- and microbial-derived compounds to stabilized SOM, i. e., aggregates and mineral-associated organic matter (MAOM), and review the role of environmental factors influencing this contribution. Extrapolating amino sugar concentrations in soil based on molecular stoichiom­ etry, we find that microbial necromass accounts for \textasciitilde 50\% (agroecosystems) or less (forest ecosystems) of the C stabilized within aggregates and MAOM across studies. This implies that plant biomolecules, including lipids, lignin, and sugars, might account for a substantial portion (≥50\%) of the organic matter protected by minerals and aggregates. Indeed, plant-specific sugars and lipids can each account for as much as 10\% of organic C within mineral soil fractions, and most reported quantities of plant-specific lipids and lignin in mineral soil fractions are likely underestimates due to irreversible sorption to minerals. A relatively balanced contribution of plant and microbial biomolecules to stabilized SOM in aggregates and MAOM is inconsistent with recent suggestions that stable SOM is comprised mostly of microbial compounds.},

Particulate and mineral-associated organic matter in water-stable aggregates as affected by mineral fertilizer and manure applications. Can. J. Soil Sci. 79: 295–302. Application of cattle manure generally improves soil structure and organic matter (OM) content. However, changes in forms and location of OM within the aggregate structure are less well known. The effects of long-term (18-yr) applications of cattle manure (20 Mg ha–1 yr–1) and NPK fertilizer on the distribution of particulate and mineral-associated organic matter in water-stable aggregates were investigated in a Le Bras loam (Humic Gleysol). Soil samples from the 0- to 10-cm depth were taken from the untreated control, NPK, manure and NPK + manure treatments. They were separated into four aggregate-size fractions ({$>$}1000 µm, 250–1000 µm, 53–250 µm, and {$<$}53 µm) by slaking air-dried soil, followed by wet sieving. Particulate ({$>$}53 µm) and mineral-associated OM ({$<$}53 µm) were separated from water-stable aggregates {$>$}53 µm by sieving after mechanical dispersion. After 18 yr, manure increased the OM level of the whole soil and favored formation of slaking-resistant macroaggregates (250–1000 µm). This effect was primarily a result of the OM added by the manure. In contrast, NPK fertilizer did not affect soil OM level or macroaggregation. The increase in OM induced by manure application was observed primarily in macroaggregates, and both as mineral-associated and particulate OM. However, manure did not change OM located in the fraction {$<$}53 µm confirming that recently deposited OM preferentially accumulates within the aggregate structure and not in the finely or non-aggregated material. Since previous studies have shown that most of the C in cattle manure is composed of coarse particles, we hypothesize that manure-derived OM first enters the soil primarily as particulate material, then, during decomposition, is transformed within the aggregate structure into mineralassociated material thereby contributing to aggregate stabilization.},

Soil from the 0- to 10-cm depth was sampled from the untreated control, NPK, manure and NPK + manure treatments and fractionated into four size classes of slaking-resistant aggregates ({$>$}1000\hspace{0.6em}µm, 250–1000\hspace{0.6em}µm, 53–250\hspace{0.6em}µm, {$<$}53\hspace{0.6em}µm). Intact and crushed macroaggregates (250–1000 and {$>$}1000\hspace{0.6em}µm) and intact microaggregates ({$<$}250\hspace{0.6em}µm) were incubated for 21\hspace{0.6em}d at 25 °C, and mineralized C and N were determined. The amount of mineralized C in intact aggregates increased with increasing aggregate size irrespective of the agronomic treatments, but there was no consistent trend for total N. Manure application led to an increase in mineralized C in most aggregate fractions. Crushing the macroaggregates enhanced mineralization of C by 14 to 35\% and N by 17 to 103\%. Additional C and N rendered mineralizable by crushing represents a fraction of the macroaggregate-protected OM. Manure application increased the protected pools of C (up to threefold) and N (up to fourfold) located in the small macroaggregates (250–1000\hspace{0.6em}µm). In contrast, NPK fertilization increased the pool of macroaggregate-protected N by 2.5-fold but had no effect on the protected C. We conclude that manure application contributed to the accumulation of macroaggregate-protected C and N, whereas mineral fertilizers increased the protected-N pool only. Macroaggregates can provide a mechanism for the protection of labile soil OM in an annually tilled cropping system and this mechanism is enhanced with long-term manure application. Key words: Aggregate-protected organic matter, manure application, mineralization, mineral fertilizer, water-stable aggregates},

  abstract = {The stock of organic carbon contained within a soil represents the balance between inputs and losses. Inputs are defined by the ability of vegetation to capture and retain carbon dioxide, effects that management practices have on the proportion of captured carbon that is added to soil and the application organic amendments. The proportion of organic amendment carbon retained is defined by its rate of mineralisation. In this study, the rate of carbon mineralisation from 85 different potential soil organic amendments (composts, manures, plant residues and biosolids) was quantified under controlled environmental conditions over a 547 day incubation period. The composition of each organic amendment was quantified using nuclear magnetic resonance and mid- and nearinfrared spectroscopies. Cumulative mineralisation of organic carbon from the amendments was fitted to a twopool exponential model. Multivariate chemometric algorithms were derived to allow the size of the fast and slow cycling pools of carbon to be predicted from the acquired spectroscopic data. However, the fast and slow decomposition rate constants could not be predicted suggesting that prediction of the residence time of organic amendment carbon in soil would likely require additional information related to soil type, environmental conditions, and management practices in use at the site of application.},

Presently, the changes in soil organic carbon (SOC) stock can arise because of the climatic changes or changes in the land use and land management. A promising method in the estimation of SOC changes is modelling, one of the most used models for the prediction of changes in soil organic carbon stock on agricultural land being the RothC model. Because of its simplicity and availability of the input data, RothC was used for testing the efficiency to predict the development of SOC stock during 35-year period on agricultural land of Slovakia. The received data show an increase of SOC stock during the first (20 years) phase and no significant changes in the course of the second part of modelling. The increase of SOC stock in the first phase can be explained by a high carbon input of plant residues and manure and a lower temperature in comparison with the second modelling part.},

This paper reviews techniques available across various fields for characterising the performance of environmental models with focus on numerical, graphical and qualitative methods. General classes of direct value comparison, coupling real and modelled values, preserving data patterns, indirect metrics based on parameter values, and data transformations are discussed. In practice environmental modelling requires the use and implementation of workflows that combine several methods, tailored to the model purpose and dependent upon the data and information available. A five-step procedure for performance evaluation of models is suggested, with the key elements including: (i) (re)assessment of the model’s aim, scale and scope; (ii) characterisation of the data for calibration and testing; (iii) visual and other analysis to detect under- or non-modelled behaviour and to gain an overview of overall performance; (iv) selection of basic performance criteria; and (v) consideration of more advanced methods to handle problems such as systematic divergence between modelled and observed values.},

  abstract = {The decomposition of seven different organic waste mixtures prepared with sewage sludges, animal manures, city refuse and industrial and plant residues, was studied during their aerobic incubation with soil. The waste mixtures were composted by the Rutgers static pile system, and four samples of each mixture were collected at various composting stages: the initial mixture, and samples taken during the thermophilic phase, at the end of the active phase and after maturation. These samples were added to a calcareous silt loam soil at a rate of 200 mg per 10 g soil, and the CO2±C evolution was determined during 70 days of aerobic incubation at 288C. Carbon mineralization decreased as the composting time lengthened. The lowest values of C mineralization were found for the mature samples, and only a compost which had not attained an advanced degree of maturation gave results higher than 25\% of TOC. Carbon mineralization followed a combined ®rst- and zero-order kinetic model in most of the samples, suggesting that the organic C of the composting wastes was made up of two organic pools of differing degrees of stability. However, the differences in the slow C mineralization pool at the end of the active phase and after maturation were very small, indicating that the organic matter at both stages was of a similar microbial stability. Comparing the C mineralization which takes place in soil and during composting, it can be concluded that composting is the best way of obtaining maximum C stabilization, which is an important factor in soil conservation and reclamation. \# 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

  abstract = {Carbon content in soils changes depending on the land use system, type of management practice and time. There is an increasing concern about the soil quality vis-à-vis organic carbon content in soils due to global warming and enhanced CO2 concentration in the atmosphere. This has led to estimate carbon stock in soils at global and regional levels. The objective of the present study was to evaluate RothC model to estimate total organic carbon (TOC) changes under four long term fertilizer experimental sites representing subhumid moist (Sarol and Nabibagh), sub-humid dry (Panjri) and semi-arid (Teligi) climate in India. The plant carbon input rate was calibrated using organic carbon and other soil parameters using RothC. The results showed that RothC could simulate changes in TOC in two contrasting eco-sites for surface soil layers. The root mean square error (RMSE) considered as modelling error ranged from 11.50 to 15.01, 4.70 to 11.60, 2.14 to 6.52 and 1.45 to 13.74 in the surface layers of Sarol, Nabibagh, Panjri, and Teligi sites, respectively. The simulation biases expressed by M (relative error) by Student‘t’ value for all the treatments at these sites were non-significant with two exceptions. Observed trends in TOC consist of an increase for all the four treatments in the sub-humid site of Sarol and Nabibagh; while manures alone or in combination increase TOC appreciably in Teligi and Panjri. TOC remained, however, almost similar over years for the control (no fertilizer or manure) and NPK treatments in all the four sites. Analysis of RothC output data showed that this model could be used as a tool to arrive at different threshold values of rainfall to influence decomposition rate modifier and thus to find out rate of organic carbon sequestration in various bioclimatic systems.},

  abstract = {Soil is a key compartment for climate regulation as a source of greenhouse gases (GHGs) emissions and as a sink of carbon. Thus, soil carbon sequestration strategies should be considered alongside reduction strategies for other greenhouse gas emissions. Taking this into account, several international and European policies on climate change are now acknowledging the importance of soils, which means that proper, comparable and reliable information is needed to report on carbon stocks and GHGs emissions from soil. It also implies a need for consensus on the adoption and verification of mitigation options that soil can provide. Where consensus is a key aspect, formal standards and guidelines come into play. This paper describes the existing ISO soil quality standards that can be used in this context, and calls for new ones to be developed through (international) collaboration. Available standards cover the relevant basic soil parameters including carbon and nitrogen content but do not yet consider the dynamics of those elements. Such methods have to be developed together with guidelines consistent with the scale to be investigated and the specific use of the collected data. We argue that this standardization strategy will improve the reliability of the reporting procedures and results of the different climate models that rely on soil quality data.},

As any tool developed by research, indicators must be elaborated according to a scientific approach. One of the important steps of this elaboration is the validation. The overall objective of this paper is to present a methodological framework to validate indicators. According to the definition of an indicator, three kinds of validation are presented: the ‘‘design validation’’ to evaluate if the indicators are scientifically founded; the ‘‘output validation’’ to assess the soundness of the indicator outputs, and, the ‘‘end use validation’’ to be sure the indicator is useful and used as a decision aid tool. The output validation is inspired from validation of simulation models, which is shortly reviewed. Because indicators differ from models in many cases, validation procedures commonly used in modelling have to be adapted.},

We present a method for estimating NPP and annual C inputs to soil for some common Canadian agroecosystems, using a series of plant C allocation coefficients for each crop type across the country. The root-derived C in these coefficients was estimated by reviewing studies reporting information on plant shoot-to-root (S:R) ratios (n = 168).

The review also showed considerable uncertainty (coefficient of variation for S:R ratios of \$50\% for annual crops and \$75\% for perennial forages) in estimating below-ground NPP (BNPP) in agroecosystems; uncertainty was similar to that for Canadian boreal forests. The BNPP (including extra-root C) was lower for annual crops (\$20\% of NPP) than for perennial forages (\$50\%). The latter was similar to estimates for relative below-ground C allocation in other Canadian natural ecosystems such as mixed grasslands and forests. The proposed method is easy to use, specific for particular crops, management practices, and driven by agronomic yields.

  abstract = {International initiatives are emphasizing the capture of atmospheric CO2 in soil organic C (SOC) to reduce the climatic footprint from agroecosystems. One approach to quantify the contribution of management practices towards that goal is through analysis of long-term experiments (LTEs). Our objectives were to analyze knowledge gained in literature reviews on SOC changes in LTEs, to evaluate the results regarding interactions with pedo-climatological factors, and to discuss disparities among reviews in data selection criteria. We summarized mean response ratios (RRs) and stock change rate (SCR) effect size indices from twenty reviews using paired comparisons (N). The highest RRs were found with manure applications (30\%, N\,=\,418), followed by aboveground crop residue retention and the use of cover crops (9–10\%, N\,=\,995 and 129), while the effect of nitrogen fertilization was lowest (6\%, N\,=\,846). SCR for nitrogen fertilization exceeded that for aboveground crop residue retention (233 versus 117~kg~C~ha−1~year−1, N\,=\,183 and 279) and was highest for manure applications and cover crops (409 and 331~kg~C~ha−1~year−1, N\,=\,217 and 176). When data allows, we recommend calculating both RR and SCR because it improves the interpretation. Our synthesis shows that results are not always consistent among reviews and that interaction with texture and climate remain inconclusive. Selection criteria for study durations are highly variable, resulting in irregular conclusions for the effect of time on changes in SOC. We also discuss the relationships of SOC changes with yield and cropping systems, as well as conceptual problems when scaling-up results obtained from field studies to regional levels.},

Soil organic carbon sequestration potential for Canadian agricultural ecoregions calculated using the Introductory Carbon Balance Model. Can. J. Soil Sci. 88: 451Á460. The potential for storage of atmospheric CO2-C as soil organic C (SOC) in agroecosystems depends largely on soil biological activity and the quantity and quality of annual C inputs to soil. In this study we used the Introductory Carbon Balance Model (ICBM) approach driven by daily standard weather station data, specific soil properties and crop characteristics at the scale of Canadian agricultural ecoregions. The objectives were to calculate a climate-dependent soil biological activity parameter representative for annual agricultural crop production systems (re\_crop) and to estimate the effect of fallow (re\_fallow). These parameters are based on the daily product of soil temperature and stored water that influence biological activity in the arable layer, and are used to adjust the decomposition rates of the ICBM SOC pools. We also tested re\_crop and re\_fallow on SOC stock change data for different site and treatment combinations from long-term field experiments located in some of the ecoregions. An re\_crop value of 0.95 for western ecoregions was on average 0.23 units lower than that of the eastern ecoregions, indicating a lower decomposition rate of SOC. Although the estimated annual C inputs to soil for small-grain cereals were on average :7.5\% higher in the eastern ecoregions (305 vs. 285 g C m(2 yr(1), the overall results suggest that the western ecoregions would have a greater potential to maintain high SOC levels in the long term. However, these parameters varied between ecoregions and, consequently, the SOC sequestration potential was not always higher for the western ecoregions. The effect of fallow was on average :0.04, i.e., SOC decomposed slightly faster under fallow. Predictions for 24 out of 33 site and treatment combinations across Canada were significantly improved (P00.003), compared with a previous application with the ICBM that did not differentiate between crops and fallow. The methodology used here enabled us to examine regional differences in the potential for SOC sequestration as a balance between annual C inputs to soil and soil biological activity.},

Soil organic C stocks for calibration were obtained in 2007 from sampling (0 to 20 cm depth) farm fields under agricultural land use for more than 80 years and an adjacent undisturbed forest tract (representing native soil conditions). Additionally, we adjusted the Century crop parameters to reflect commonly observed corn, wheat and soybean biomass C additions to soils in the study region. We conducted statistical analysis for measured and simulated stocks from ten farms where agricultural land use started between 1901 and 1987. We concluded that the Century model could adequately estimate SOC stock changes as affected by agriculture in this region.},

  abstract = {Rangelands make an important contribution to carbon dynamics of terrestrial ecosystems. We used a readily accessible interface (COMET VR) to a simulation model (CENTURY) to predict changes in soil carbon in response to management changes commonly associated with conservation programs. We also used a subroutine of the model to calculate an estimate of uncertainty of the model output based on the similarity between climate, soil, and management history inputs and those used previously to parameterize the model for common land use (cropland to perennial grassland) and management (stocking rate reductions and legume addition) changes to test the validity of the approach across the southwestern United States. The conversion of small grain cropland to perennial cover was simulated acceptably (, 20\% uncertainty) by the model for soil, climate, and management history attributes representative of 32\% of land area currently in small grain production, while the simulation of small grain cropland to perennial cover + legumes was acceptable on 73\% of current small grain production area. The model performed poorly on arid and semiarid rangelands for both management (reduced stocking) and restoration (legume addition) practices. Only 66\% of land area currently used as rangeland had climate, soil, and management attributes that resulted in acceptable uncertainty. Based on our results, it will be difficult to credibly predict changes to soil carbon resulting from common land use and management practices, both at fine and coarse scales. To overcome these limitations, we propose an integrated system of spatially explicit direct measurement of soil carbon at locations with well-documented management histories and climatic records to better parameterize the model for rangeland applications. Further, because the drivers of soil carbon fluxes on rangelands are dominated by climate rather than management, the interface should be redesigned to simulate soil carbon changes based on ecological state rather than practice application.},

  abstract = {Daisy is a semi-mechanistic model that simulates crop production, soil water and C and N dynamics in agro-ecosystems. In this study, the soil organic matter (SOM) submodel of Daisy was calibrated and validated with data from a series of long-term (30 – 100 yr) experiments dominated by cereal cropping systems. The experiments were conducted under temperate conditions at the Askov Experimental Station, Denmark. The recalibration of the Daisy model improved the model simulations considerably. The RMSE between simulations and observations of the experiments used for calibration improved from 33 to 19, whereas this measure improved from 32 to 9.0 for the experiments used for validation. The original calibration of the model appears to be based upon too low an input of organic matter (especially because rhizodeposition is ignored), too low an efficiency with which added organic matter is converted into more stable forms of SOM, and too low an overall decomposition rate. Our study suggests that the fraction of SOM involved in medium-term turnover is substantially larger than previously thought and inferred by most SOM turnover models. This may warrant a recalibration of current simulation models, and stresses the importance of using long-term experiments with widely differing treatments for model evaluation. Long-term treatments with widely contrasting initial C contents and annual C inputs, especially bare fallow treatments, appear to be valuable resources in this respect. q 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Prior to stabilization, microbial necromass may be recycled by the microbial community. We propose that the efficiency of this recycling is a critical determinant of soil carbon stabilization rates. Here we explore the controls on necromass recycling efficiency in 27 UK grassland soils using stable isotope tracing and indicator species analysis. We found that recycling efficiency was unaffected by land management. Instead, recycling efficiency increased with microbial growth rate on necromass, and was highest in soils with low historical precipitation. We identified bacterial and fungal indicators of necromass recycling efficiency, which could be used to clarify soil carbon stabilization mechanisms. We conclude that environmental and microbial controls have a strong influence on necromass recycling, and suggest that this, in turn, influences soil carbon stabilization.},

Recent research on necromass and soil carbon storage has focused on necromass production and stabilization mechanisms but not on the mechanisms of necromass retention. We present evidence from soil incubations with stable-isotope labeled necromass that abiotic adsorption may be more important than biotic immobilization for short-term necromass retention. We demon­ strate that necromass adsorbs not only to mineral surfaces, but may also interact with other necromass. Furthermore, necromass cell chemistry alters necromass-necromass interaction, with more bacterial tracer retained when there is yeast necromass present. These findings suggest that the adsorption and abiotic inter­ action of microbial necromass and its functional properties, beyond chemical stability, deserve further investi­ gation in the context of soil carbon sequestration.},

  abstract = {Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is vital to climate change mitigation, and has application across the economy, in addition to facilitating atmospheric carbon dioxide removal resulting in emissions offsets and net negative emissions. This contribution reviews the state-of-the-art and identifies key challenges which must be overcome in order to pave the way for its large-scale deployment.           ,                             Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is broadly recognised as having the potential to play a key role in meeting climate change targets, delivering low carbon heat and power, decarbonising industry and, more recently, its ability to facilitate the net removal of CO               2               from the atmosphere. However, despite this broad consensus and its technical maturity, CCS has not yet been deployed on a scale commensurate with the ambitions articulated a decade ago. Thus, in this paper we review the current state-of-the-art of CO               2               capture, transport, utilisation and storage from a multi-scale perspective, moving from the global to molecular scales. In light of the COP21 commitments to limit warming to less than 2 °C, we extend the remit of this study to include the key negative emissions technologies (NETs) of bioenergy with CCS (BECCS), and direct air capture (DAC). Cognisant of the non-technical barriers to deploying CCS, we reflect on recent experience from the UK's CCS commercialisation programme and consider the commercial and political barriers to the large-scale deployment of CCS. In all areas, we focus on identifying and clearly articulating the key research challenges that could usefully be addressed in the coming decade.},

  abstract = {Summer fallow (fallow) is still widely used on the North American Great Plains to replenish soil moisture between crops. Our objective was to examine how fallowing affects soil organic carbon (SOC) in various agronomic and climate settings by reviewing long-term studies in the midwestern USA (five sites) and the Canadian prairies (17 sites). In most soils, SOC increased with cropping frequency though not usually in a linear fashion. In the Canadian studies, SOC response to tillage and cropping frequency varied with climate—in semiarid conditions, SOC gains under no-till were about 250 kg haϪ1 yrϪ1 greater than for tilled systems regardless of cropping frequency; in subhumid environments, the advantage was about 50 kg haϪ1 yrϪ1 for rotations with fallow but 250 kg haϪ1 yrϪ1 with continuous cropping. Specific crops also influenced SOC: Replacing wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) with lentil (Lens culinaris Medikus) had little effect; replacing wheat with lower-yielding flax (Linum usitatismum L.) reduced SOC gains; and replacing wheat with erosion-preventing fall rye (Secale cereale L.) increased SOC gains. In unfertilized systems, cropping frequency did not affect SOC gains, but in fertilized systems, SOC gains often increased with cropping frequency. In a Colorado study (three sites each with three slope positions), SOC gains increased with cropping frequency, but the response tended to be highest at the lowest potential evaporation site (where residue C inputs were greatest) and least in the toeslope positions (despite their high residue C inputs). The Century and the Campbell et al. SOC models satisfactorily simulated the relative responses of SOC although they underestimated gains by about one-third.},

  abstract = {Some natural ecosystems near industrialized and agricultural areas receive atmospheric nitrogen inputs that are an order of magnitude greater than those presumed for preindustrial times. Because nitrogen (N) often limits microbial growth on dead vegetation, increased N input can be expected to affect the ecosystem process of decomposition. We found that extracellular enzyme responses of a forest-floor microbial community to chronically applied aqueous NH4NO3 can explain both increased and decreased litter decomposition rates caused by added N. Microbes responded to N by increasing cellulase activity in decaying leaf litter of flowering dogwood, red maple, and red oak, but in highlignin oak litter, the activity of lignin-degrading phenol oxidase declined substantially. We believe this is the first report of reduced ligninolytic enzyme activity caused by chronic N addition in an ecosystem. This result provides evidence that ligninolytic enzyme suppression can be an important mechanism explaining decreased decay rates of plant matter seen in this and other N-addition experiments. Since lignin and cellulose are the two most abundant organic resources on earth, these altered enzyme responses signal that atmospheric N deposition may be affecting the global carbon cycle by influencing the activities of microbes and their carbon-acquiring enzymes—especially the unique ligninolytic enzymes produced by white-rot fungi—over broad geographic areas.},

However, the effect of litter quality on SOM stabilization is inconsistent. High-quality litters, characterized by high N concentrations, low C/N ratios, and low phenol/lignin concentrations, are not consistently stabilized in SOM with greater efficiency than ‘low-quality’ litters characterized by low N concentrations, high C/N ratios, and high phenol/lignin concentrations. Here, we attempt to resolve these inconsistent results by developing a new conceptual model that links litter quality to the soil C saturation concept. Our model builds on the Microbial Efficiency-Matrix Stabilization framework (Cotrufo et al., 2013) by suggesting the effect of litter quality on SOM stabilization is modulated by the extent of soil C saturation such that high-quality litters are not always stabilized in SOM with greater efficiency than low-quality litters.},

A field experiment was conducted on a sandy loam unamended (control) or amended with 60 m3 ha–1 pig slurry (PS) or 4 temperature, microbial biomass MC,gahnad–1NbOa3r–leayndstNraHw4+(BcSon),teonrtbs owther(ePmSBonSi)t.oSreudrfdaucerinCgO228anddinNt2hOe fluxes, soil water content and 0- to 20-cm soil layer. Large CO2 fluxes occurred during the first 4 h of the experiment in slurry-amended plots that were attributed to carbonate dissociation when slurry was mixed to the soil. Specific respiration activity (ratio of CO2-C fluxes-to-microbial biomass C) was increased in slurry-amended soils for the first 7 d, likely due to the rapid oxidation of volatile fatty acids present in slurry. After 28 d, 26\% more C had been evolved in PSBS than the sum of C released from PS and BS, indicating a synergistic interaction during decomposition of combined amendments. Adding straw caused a net but transient immobilisation of soil N, especially in PSBS plots where 36\% of slurry-added NH4+ was not a significant source of N was immobilised after 3 d. Slurry-NH4+ was rapidly loss during this study, representing less than 0.3\% nitrified (within 10 d), of slurry-added NH4+. but N2O production Nevertheless, about twice the amount of N2O was produced in PS than in PSBS after 28 d, reflecting lower soil N availability in the presence of straw. Our study clearly illustrates the strong interaction existing between soil C and N cycles under field conditions as slurry mineral N appeared to stimulate straw-C mineralisation, whereas straw addition caused a net immobilisation of slurry N.},

  abstract = {Agricultural soils in North America can be a sink for rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations through the formation of soil organic matter (SOM) or humus. Humification is limited by the availability of nutrients such as nitrogen (N). Recommended management practices (RMPs) that optimize N availability foster humus formation. This review examines the management practices that contribute to maximizing N availability for optimizing sequestration of atmospheric CO2 into soil humus. Farming practices that enhance nutrient use, reduce or eliminate tillage, and increase crop intensity, together, affect N availability and, therefore, C sequestration. N additions, from especially, livestock manure and leguminous cover crops are necessary for increasing grain and biomass yields and returning crop residues to the soil thereby increasing soil organic carbon (SOC) concentration. Conservation tillage practices enhance also the availability of N and increase SOC concentration. Increase in cropping intensity and/or crop rotations produce higher quantity and quality of residues, increase availability of N, and therefore foster increase in C sequestration. The benefit of C sequestration from N additions may be negated by CO2 and N2O emissions associated with production and application of N fertilizers. More studies need to be conducted to ascertain the benefits of adding N via manuring versus N fertilizer additions. Furthermore, site specific adaptive research is needed to identify RMPs that optimize soil N use efficiency while improving crop yield and C sequestration thereby curbing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Due to the wide range of climate in North America, there is a large range of C sequestration potential in agricultural soils through N management. Humid croplands may have the potential to sequester 8–298 Tg C yr−1 while dry croplands may sequester 1–35 Tg C yr−1. These estimates, however, are highly uncertain and wide-ranging. Clearly, more research is needed to quantify, more precisely, the C sequestration potential across different N management scenarios especially in Mexico and Canada.},

Our estimates of the potential reduction of radiative forcing by the agricultural sector range from 1.15-3.3 Gt C equivalents per year. Of the total potential reduction, approximately 32\% could result from reduction in CO2 emissions, 42\% of carbon offsets by biofuel production on 15\% of existing croplands, 16\% from reduced CH4 emissions and 10\% from reduced emissions of N2O. Agriculture encompasses large regional differences in management practices and rates of potential adoption of mitigation practices. Acceptability of mitigation options will depend on the extent to which sustainable production will be achieved or maintained and benefits will accrue to farmers. Technologies such as no-till farming and strategic fertilizer placement and timing are now being adopted for reasons other than concern for climate change issues.},

Here, we used the CENTURY model to simulate SOC in wheat-corn cropping systems at three long-term fertilization trials. Our study indicates that CENTURY can simulate fertilization effects on SOC dynamics under different climate and soil conditions. The normalized root mean square error is less than 15\% for all the treatments. Soil carbon presents various changes under different fertilization management. Treatment with straw return would enhance SOC to a relatively stable level whereas chemical fertilization affects SOC differently across the three sites. After running CENTURY over the period of 1990–2050, the SOC levels are predicted to increase from 31.8 to 52.1 Mg ha21 across the three sites. We estimate that the carbon sequestration potential between 1990 and 2050 would be 9.4–35.7 Mg ha21 under the current high manure application at the three sites. Analysis of SOC in each carbon pool indicates that long-term fertilization enhances the slow pool proportion but decreases the passive pool proportion. Model results suggest that change in the slow carbon pool is the major driver of the overall trends in SOC stocks under long-term fertilization.},

  abstract = {Mineral-associated organic matter (MAOM) is a relatively large and stable fraction of soil organic matter (SOM). Plant litters with high rates of mineralization (high quality litters) are hypothesized to promote the accumulation of MAOM with greater efficiency than plant litters with low rates of mineralization (low-quality litters) because litters with high rates of mineralization maximize the synthesis of microbial products and most MAOM is microbial-derived. However, the effect of litter quality on MAOM is inconsistent. We conducted four repeated short-term incubations (46-d each) of four plant litters (alfalfa, oats, maize and soybean) in two low-carbon subsoils (sandy loam and silty loam) with and without nutrient addition. Our short-term incubations focused on the initial stage of litter decomposition during the time when litter quality has a measureable effect on mineralization rates. Plant litter quality had a much greater effect on litter-C mineralization rate and MAOM-C accumulation than did soil type or nutrient addition. Soils amended with high-quality oat and alfalfa litters had greater MAOM-C accumulation than soils amended with low-quality maize and soybean litters. However, soils amended with high-quality litters also had greater litter-C mineralization than soils amended with low-quality litters. As a result, the accumulation of MAOM-C per unit of litter-C mineralization was lower in soils amended with high-vs. low-quality litters (0.65 vs. 1.39 g MAOM-C accumulated g−1 C mineralized). Cellulose and hemicelluose indices of accumulated MAOM were greater for maize and soybean than oats and alfalfa, however, most carbohydrates in MAOM were plant-derived regardless of litter quality. At the end of the incubations, more of the accumulated MAOM-N was potentially mineralizable in soils amended with high quality litters. Nevertheless, most of the litter-C remained as residual litter; just 12\% was mineralized to CO2 and 13\% was transferred to MAOM. Our results demonstrate several unexpected effects of litter quality on MAOM stabilization including the direct stabilization of plant-derived carbohydrates.},

Yet, research on litter decay and SOM formation has been largely uncoupled, failing to provide an effective nexus between these two fundamental processes for carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling and storage. We present the current understanding of the importance of microbial substrate use efficiency and C and N allocation in controlling the proportion of plant-derived C and N that is incorporated into SOM, and of soil matrix interactions in controlling SOM stabilization. We synthesize this understanding into the Microbial Efficiency-Matrix Stabilization (MEMS) framework. This framework leads to the hypothesis that labile plant constituents are the dominant source of microbial products, relative to input rates, because they are utilized more efficiently by microbes. These microbial products of decomposition would thus become the main precursors of stable SOM by promoting aggregation and through strong chemical bonding to the mineral soil matrix.},

  abstract = {Microbial activity has been highlighted as one of the main unknowns controlling the fate and turnover of soil organic matter (SOM) in response to climate change. How microbial community structure and function may (or may not) interact with increasing temperature to impact the fate and turnover of SOM, in particular when combined with changes in litter chemistry, is not well understood. The primary aim of this study was to determine if litter chemistry impacted the decomposition of soil and litter-derived carbon (C), and its interaction with temperature, and whether this response was controlled by microbial community structure and function. Fresh or pre-incubated eucalyptus leaf litter (13C enriched) was added to a woodland soil and incubated at 12, 22, or 32  C. We tracked the movement of litter and soilderived C into CO2, water-extractable organic carbon (WEOC), and microbial phospholipids (PLFA). The litter additions produced significant changes in every parameter measured, while temperature, interacting with litter chemistry, predominately affected soil C respiration (priming and temperature sensitivity), microbial community structure, and the metabolic quotient (a proxy for microbial carbon use efficiency [CUE]). The direction of priming varied with the litter additions (negative with fresh litter, positive with pre-incubated litter) and was related to differences in the composition of microbial communities degrading soil-C, particularly gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, resulting from litter addition. Soil-C decomposition in both litter treatments was more temperature sensitive (higher Q10) than in the soil-only control, and soil-C priming became increasingly positive with temperature. However, microbes utilizing soil-C in the litter treatments had higher CUE, suggesting the longer-term stability of soil-C may be increased at higher temperature with litter addition. Our results show that in the same soil, the growth of distinct microbial communities can alter the turnover and fate of SOM and, in the context of global change, its response to temperature.},

  abstract = {Soil organic matter (SOM) improves soil fertility and mitigates disturbance related to climate and land use change. Microbial necromass (the accumulated cellular residues of microorganisms) comprises the majority of soil C, yet the formation and persistence of necromass in relation to mineralogy is poorly understood. We tested whether soil minerals had different microbial necromass association mechanisms. Specifically, we tested whether microbial necromass directly sorbed to mineral surfaces or was consumed by live microorganisms prior to mineral association. Applying Raman microspectroscopy with 13C enriched microbial necromass to quantify microbe-mineral interactions, we show that mineralogy alters the initial mechanism of microbial necromass association. In the presence of K-feldspar (lower abiotic C preservation potential), microbial necromass required assimilation by live microorganisms for mineral retention. In contrast, with amorphous aluminum hydroxide (higher abiotic C preservation potential) microbial necromass was retained predominately through abiotic sorption, and was subsequently protected from microbial decomposition. Despite different mechanisms, both minerals retained similar quantities of microbial necromass under biotic conditions. Mineralogy determined not only the quantity of mineral-associated C, but the distinct pathway of microbial necromass association. These findings show the utility of Raman microspectroscopy as a technique to study microbe-mineral interactions, and imply that heterogeneity in mineral-organic interactions could result in gradients of organic matter stability.},

  abstract = {Understanding phosphorus (P) loss in soils receiving nutrients from various sources in combination with drainage water management strategies is important to develop risk assessment tools and BMPs that minimize adverse impacts of agricultural practice on water quality. An experiment was conducted in a clay loam soil of Eastern Canada over a 4-year period to determine crop yields and soil P losses in surface runoff (SR) and sub-surface tile drainage (TD) as influenced by additions of liquid (LCM) and solid cattle manures (SCM), in comparison with chemical fertilizer (CF), under regular free drainage (RFD) and controlled drainage/sub-irrigation (CDS). Cropping system was corn-soybean rotation, with a unified amount of P, 50 kg P ha-1, added from each of the three sources to the corn phase. Surface runoff and sub-surface tile drainage flows were monitored and samples collected continuously year round using an auto-sampling system. Water samples were analyzed for dissolved reactive (DRP), dissolved un-reactive P, and particular P. Both P source and drainage water management affected corn yields, but not on the soybean yield. Corn yield was the highest with CF, followed by SCM, with the LCM the lowest. Controlled drainage and sub-irrigation decreased slightly the corn yield, relative to RFD. Annual total P losses (ATPL) through both SR and TD were 4740 g P ha-1 in the CF control plots, but decreased to 4383 and 3834 g P ha-1 with added LCM and SCM, respectively, under RFD. Under CDS, ATPL was 4228 g P ha-1 in the CF control plots, and decreased to 3996 and 3453 g P ha-1 with added LCM and SCM, respectively. Of the ATPL, from 40\% to 63 \% was attributed to P loss in sub-surface tile drainage water. Dissolved reactive P accounted for 26, 23, and 50\% of the soil P loss for CF, LCM and SCM treatments, respectively, and the percentages were similar between RFD and CDS. Annual total soil P loss followed the order of CF{$>$}LCM{$>$}SCM, but generally reduced with CDS, regardless of P sources. An optimized combination of nutrient source with drainage water management must be developed to maximize production profitability, while minimizing soil P losses to water resource.},

  abstract = {Hydrologic and water quality (H/WQ) models are widely used to support site-specific environmental assessment, design, planning, and decision making. Calibration and validation (C/V) are fundamental processes used to demonstrate that an H/WQ model can produce suitable results in a particular application. However, the lack of comprehensive guidelines has led to the use of ad hoc, inconsistent, and incomplete C/V processes, which have made it difficult to interpret the myriad of published modeling studies, reduced the utility of many modeling applications, and slowed the advancement of H/WQ modeling. The objective of this article is to provide a generalized structure and process to assist modelers in developing a C/V strategy for H/WQ modeling applications. These best practice recommendations were developed based on an expansive review of the modeling literature, including a special collection of articles on H/WQ model calibration, validation, and use, as well as extensive discussion and debate among the authors. The model C/V recommendations include careful consideration, execution, and documentation of the following elements: (1) goals of model use, (2) data and parameters used in C/V, and (3) model C/V processes. Considerations in element 3 include the warm-up period, C/V strategy complexity, C/V process staging, spatiotemporal allocation of C/V comparison data, manual vs. automatic C/V, and additional diagnostics. Notable examples from the literature are provided for each strategy element. The comprehensive C/V strategy described herein will allow for better interpretation of future modeling studies, improved utility of modeling applications, and more systematic advancement of H/WQ models.},

This paper demonstrates efficient computational methods using a one-pool model of the soil carbon dynamics previously used to predict soil carbon stock change under different agricultural practices applied at Tarlee, South Australia. We focus on methods that can improve the speed of computation when estimating parameters and model state variables in a statistically defensible way. This paper also serves as a tutorial on advanced Bayesian methods for fitting complex state-space models, which will be of interest to soil scientists and other environmental scientists more generally.},

  abstract = {RothC is an established model for predicting soil organic carbon (SOC) changes in response to environmental conditions and management. The model lacks algorithms for carbon input estimation and a differentiated consideration of carbon input sequestration from organic amendments commonly used in agriculture. Moreover, it does not consider the higher stability of below-ground crop residues in relation to above-ground crop residues. RothC was combined with two empirical approaches for quantifying carbon inputs from above- and belowground crop residues and tested on 439 SOC data series from 36 arable long-term field experiments in Central and Northern Europe. Effects of carbon input quality on model fit were quantified with linear mixed models based on the analytical solution of RothC. Model parameters that describe the stability of incoming carbon were calibrated using a multi-site approach and Bayesian calibration. A second calibration study combined the determination of partitioning of incoming carbon into pools with different turnover rates and model responses to temperature and soil water content. With this calibration we showed that the contribution of above-ground residues to SOC is lower than when estimated with default RothC paramerization. We also show that the relative contribution from roots to SOC is higher than that from above-ground residues. Moreover, the degradability of organic amendments was highly variable between amendment categories and increased for all model configurations in the following order: farmyard manure {$<$} farmyard compost {$<$} sawdust {$<$} sewage sludge {$<$} peat. The proposed RothC partition coefficients for above-ground residues, roots and several commonly used organic amendments as estimated for this large data set should be useful for other studies in temperate climates. We also show that the analytical solution of RothC is closely related to the much simpler empirical humus balancing approaches used by farm advisory services. This provides opportunities to build bridges between the more process-oriented SOC models used in research and the well established instruments used by the farming community to assess the effects of agricultural management practices on SOC changes.},

  abstract = {Common agricultural practices such as excessive use of agro-chemicals, deep tillage and luxury irrigation have degraded soils, polluted water resources and contaminated the atmosphere. There is increasing concern about interrelated environmental problems such as soil degradation, desertification, erosion, and accelerated greenhouse effects and climate change. The decline in organic matter content of many soils is becoming a major process of soil degradation, particularly in European semi-arid Mediterranean regions. Degraded soils are not fertile and thus cannot maintain sustainable production. At the same time, the production of urban and industrial organic waste materials is widespread. Therefore, strategies for recycling such organic waste in agriculture must be developed. Here, we review long-term experiments (3–60 years) on the effects of organic amendments used both for organic matter replenishment and to avoid the application of high levels of chemical fertilizers. The major points of our analysis are: (1) many effects, e.g. carbon sequestration in the soil and possible build-up of toxic elements, evolve slowly, so it is necessary to refer to long-term trials. (2) Repeated application of exogenous organic matter to cropland led to an improvement in soil biological functions. For instance, microbial biomass carbon increased by up to 100\% using high-rate compost treatments, and enzymatic activity increased by 30\% with sludge addition. (3) Long-lasting application of organic amendments increased organic carbon by up to 90\% versus unfertilized soil, and up to 100\% versus chemical fertilizer treatments. (4) Regular addition of organic residues, particularly the composted ones, increased soil physical fertility, mainly by improving aggregate stability and decreasing soil bulk density. (5) The best agronomic performance of compost is often obtained with the highest rates and frequency of applications. Furthermore, applying these strategies, there were additional beneficial effects such as the slow release of nitrogen fertilizer. (6) Crop yield increased by up to 250\% by long-term applications of high rates of municipal solid waste compost. Stabilized organic amendments do not reduce the crop yield quality, but improve it. (7) Organic amendments play a positive role in climate change mitigation by soil carbon sequestration, the size of which is dependent on their type, the rates and the frequency of application. (8) There is no tangible evidence demonstrating negative impacts of heavy metals applied to soil, particularly when high-quality compost was used for long periods. (9) Repeated application of composted materials enhances soil organic nitrogen content by up to 90\%, storing it for mineralization in future cropping seasons, often without inducing nitrate leaching to groundwater.},

  abstract = {Process-based ecosystem models are used increasingly to evaluate the impacts of agricultural practices on soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks at various scales. One of the major sources of error and projection uncertainty in these models is the specification of the initial SOC pools sizes. However, few studies have examined errors and uncertainty over time and for various agricultural practices. The main purposes of our study were 1) to examine the impacts of initialization scenarios on CENTURY model V4.5 performance and 2) to quantify the initialization contribution to the total variance of error of the CENTURY model. We simulated the SOC dynamics of six wellcharacterized long-term experiments (LTEs) with 25 treatments across France, testing various agricultural practices (i.e., inorganic and organic fertilization, various crop rotations and straw and residues removed) using the CENTURY model while keeping the standard parameters unchanged. We applied nine initialization scenarios, each characterized by a unique combination of crop management and relaxation procedures. These relaxation procedures consisted of shifting simulated SOC and nitrogen levels at the end of the initialization period until they matched the stocks at the beginning of the experiment. At the end of the initialization period, the distribution pattern of SOC pools was similar in all scenarios for all LTEs. The slow pool represented the largest proportion of total SOC stocks (average value of 61.5\%), whereas the active and passive pools averaged 5.3\% and 27.9\%, respectively. The overall analysis of CENTURY performance indicated fair results for SOC stocks prediction (R2 values of the nine initialization scenarios ranged between 0.50 and 0.75) but weak results for SOC change prediction (R2 values of the nine initialization scenarios, ranged between 0.1 and 0.36). The root mean square error (RMSE) values were moderate compared to the total measured SOC stocks and their confidence intervals. The RMSE values ranged between 6.22 Mg ha−1 and 15.24 Mg ha−1, which corresponded to 13.1\% and 32.1\% of the initial average total SOC stock for all LTEs, respectively. The highest values were recorded for the no relaxation procedures. CENTURY model errors (i.e., simulated - observed SOC stocks) analysis showed a slight sensitivity to the initialization scenarios (approximately 6\% of the total variance of the CENTURY error). However, the second-order interaction of scenarios and LTE contributed by 33.6\%. Meanwhile, agricultural practices had the greatest impact on the variance of the CENTURY error (44.7\%) compared to other factors. Our findings suggest that the contribution of the initialization to the uncertainty in projected SOC changes is negligible compared to the uncertainty related to the model itself and simulated systems characteristics.},

  abstract = {A long-term field experiment was conducted to examine the influence of mineral fertilizer and organic manure on the equilibrium dynamics of soil organic C in an intensively cultivated fluvo-aquic soil in the Fengqiu State Key Agro-Ecological Experimental Station (Fengqiu county, Henan province, China) since September 1989. Soil CO2 flux was measured during the maize and wheat growing seasons in 2002–2003 and 2004 to evaluate the response of soil respiration to additions and/or alterations in mineral fertilizer, organic manure and various environmental factors. The study included seven treatments: organic manure (OM), half-organic manure plus halffertilizer N (NOM), fertilizer NPK (NPK), fertilizer NP (NP), fertilizer NK (NK), fertilizer PK (PK) and control (CK). Organic C in soil and the soil heavy fraction (organo-mineral complex) was increased from 4.47 to 8.61 mg C gÀ1 and from 3.32 to 5.68 mg C gÀ1, respectively, after the 13 yr application of organic manure. In contrast, organic C and the soil heavy fraction increased in NPK soil to only 5.41 and 4.38 mg C gÀ1, respectively. In the CK treatment, these parameters actually decreased from the initial C concentrations (4.47 and 3.32 mg C gÀ1) to 3.77 and 3.11 mg C gÀ1, respectively. Therefore, organic manure efficiently elevated soil organic C. However, only 66\% of the increased soil organic C was combined with clay minerals in the OM treatment. Cumulative soil CO2 emissions from inter-row soil in the OM and NPK treatments were 228 and 188 g C mÀ2 during the 2002 maize growing season, 132 and 123 g C mÀ2 during the 2002/2003 wheat growing season, and 401 and 346 g C mÀ2 yrÀ1 in 2002–2003, respectively. However, during the 2004 maize growing season, cumulative soil CO2 emissions were as high as 617 and 556 g C mÀ2, respectively, due to the contribution of rhizosphere respiration. The addition of organic manure contributed to a 16\% increase in soil CO2 emission in 2002–2003 (compared to NPK), where only 27\%, 36\% and 24\% of applied organic C was released as CO2 during the 2002 and 2004 maize growing seasons and in 2002–2003, respectively. During the 2002/2003 wheat growing season, soil CO2 flux was significantly affected by soil temperature below 20 1C, but by soil moisture (WFPS) during the 2004 maize growing season at soil temperatures above 18 1C. Optimum soil WFPS for soil CO2 flux was approximately 70\%. When WFPS was below 50\%, it no longer had a significant impact on soil CO2 flux during the 2002 maize growing season. This study indicates the application of organic manure composted with wheat straw may be a preferred strategy for increasing soil organic C and sequestering C in soil.},

  abstract = {It is widely recognized that global warming promotes soil organic carbon (SOC) decomposition, and soils thus emit more CO2 into the atmosphere because of the warming; however, the response of SOC decomposition to this warming in different soil textures is unclear. This lack of knowledge limits our projection of SOC turnover and CO2 emission from soils after future warming. To investigate the CO2 emission from soils with different textures, we conducted a 107-day incubation experiment. The soils were sampled from temperate forest and grassland in northern China. The incubation was conducted over three short-term cycles of changing temperature from 5uC to 30uC, with an interval of 5uC. Our results indicated that CO2 emissions from sand (.50 mm), silt (2–50 mm), and clay (,2 mm) particles increased exponentially with increasing temperature. The sand fractions emitted more CO2 (CO2-C per unit fraction-C) than the silt and clay fractions in both forest and grassland soils. The temperature sensitivity of the CO2 emission from soil particles, which is expressed as Q10, decreased in the order clay.silt.sand. Our study also found that nitrogen availability in the soil facilitated the temperature dependence of SOC decomposition. A further analysis of the incubation data indicated a power-law decrease of Q10 with increasing temperature. Our results suggested that the decomposition of organic carbon in fine-textured soils that are rich in clay or silt could be more sensitive to warming than those in coarse sandy soils and that SOC might be more vulnerable in boreal and temperate regions than in subtropical and tropical regions under future warming.},

  abstract = {There is increasing evidence that microorganisms participate in soil C sequestration and stabilization in the form of resistant microbial residues. The type of fertilizers influences microbial activity and community composition; however, little is known about its effect on the microbial residues and their relative contribution to soil C storage. The aim of this study was to investigate the long-term impact (21 years) of different fertilizer treatments (chemical fertilizer, crop straw, and organic manure) on microbial residues in a silty clay loam soil (Udolls, USDA Soil Taxonomy). Amino sugars were used to indicate the presence and origin of microbial residues. The five treatments were: CK, unfertilized control; NPK, chemical fertilizer NPK; NPKS1, NPK plus crop straw; NPKS2, NPK plus double amounts of straw; and NPKM, NPK plus pig manure. Long-term application of inorganic fertilizers and organic amendments increased the total amino sugar concentrations (4.4–8.4 \%) as compared with the control; and this effect was more evident in the plots that continuously received pig manure (P{$<$}0.05). The increase in total amino sugar stock was less pronounced in the straw-treated plots than the NPKM. These results indicate that the accumulation of soil amino sugars is largely influenced by the type of organic fertilizers entering the soil. Individual amino sugar enrichment in soil organic carbon was differentially influenced by the various fertilizer treatments, with a preferential accumulation of bacterial-derived amino sugars compared with fungalderived glucosamine in manured soil.},

  abstract = {The results from 14 field trials comparing the long-term (20 to 120 years) effects of fertilisers and manures (farmyard manure, slurry, and green manure) on crop production and soil properties are reviewed. In total there were 24 paired comparisons of the effects of manure and fertiliser. Some of the trials also contained a control (no nutrient inputs) treatment. The input of nutrients as either fertilisers or manures had very large effects (150–1000\%) on soil productivity as measured by crop yields. Manured soils had higher contents of organic matter and numbers of microfauna than fertilised soils, and were more enriched in P, K, Ca and Mg in topsoils and nitrate N, Ca and Mg in subsoils. Manured soils also had lower bulk density and higher porosity, hydraulic conductivity and aggregate stability, relative to fertilised soils. However, there was no significant difference (P , 0.05) between fertilisers and manures in their long-term effects on crop production. In the context of this set of international trials, the recent evidence from the Rothamsted classical long-term trials appears to be exceptional, due to the larger inputs of manures and larger accumulation of soil OM in these trials. It is suggested therefore that manures may only have a benefit on soil productivity, over and above their nutrient content, when large inputs are applied over many years. The evidence from these trials also shows that, because the ratio of nutrients in manures is different from the ratio of nutrients removed by common crops, excessive accumulation of some nutrients, and particularly P and N, can arise from the long-term use of manures, relative to the use of fertilisers. Under these conditions greater runoff of P, and leaching of N may result, and for soils with low P retention and / or in situations where organic P is leached, greater P leaching losses may occur. The use of manures, relative to fertilisers, may also contribute to poor water quality by increasing its chemical oxygen demand. It is concluded therefore that it cannot generally be assumed that the long-term use of manures will enhance soil quality – defined in terms of productivity and potential to adversely affect water quality – in the long term, relative to applying the same amounts of nutrients as fertiliser.},

  abstract = {In order to apply manure or compost to fulfill the nutrient requirements of a crop, knowledge of the amount of nutrients mineralized following application is needed. Nutrient mineralization from applied manure depends on temperature, soil moisture, soil properties, manure characteristics, and microbial activity. Since these factors cannot be accurately predicted, nutrient mineralization from applied manure can only be approximated. Nitrogen (N) availability from applied manure includes the inorganic N (N03-N and NH4-N) in manure plus the amount of organic N mineralized following application. Nitrogen mineralization differs for different manure types since the inorganic/organic fraction and quality of organic N varies among manure types. Mineralization of organic N is expected to be low for composted manure (- 18\%) and high for swine or poultry (hens) manure (- 55\%). Phosphorus (P) availability from all animal production sources of manure is high ({$>$} 70\%), as most of the manure P is inorganic and becomes plant-available after application. Potassium (K) availability from manure is nearly 100\%; therefore, manure can be used similar to K fertilizer. When manure was analyzed for plantavailable nutrients, greater than 55\% of calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg) and less than 40\% of zinc (Zn), iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), copper (Cu), sulfur (5), and boron (B) were plant-available. To effectively utilize the nutrients in manure, their mineralization potential should be considered when determining application rates.},

  abstract = {Predictive, regional use of soil organic matter (SOM) models requires evaluation of the performance of models with datasets from long-term experiments relevant to the scenarios of interest to the regional scale study, and relevant to the climate of the study region. Datasets from six long-term experiments were used to evaluate the performance of RothC and CENTURY, two of the most widely used and tested SOM models. Three types of model run were completed for each site: (1) CENTURY model alone; (2) RothC model run to ®t measured SOC values, by iteratively adjusting C inputs to soil; and (3) RothC model run using C inputs derived from CENTURY runs. In general, the performance of both models was good across all datasets. The runs using RothC (iteratively changing C inputs to ®t measured SOC values) tended to have the best ®t to model data, since this method involved direct ®tting to observed data. Carbon inputs estimated by RothC were, in general, lower than those estimated by CENTURY, since SOC in CENTURY tends to turn over faster than SOC in RothC. The runs using RothC with CENTURY C inputs tended to have the poorest ®t of all, since CENTURY predicted greater C inputs than were required by RothC to maintain the same SOC content. A plausible model ®t to measured SOC data may be obtained with widely differing C input values, due to differences in predicted decomposition rates between models. It remains unclear which, if either, modelling approach most closely represents reality since both C inputs to soil and decomposition rates for bulk SOM are dif®cult to determine experimentally. Further progress in SOM modelling can only be the result of research leading to better process understanding, both of net C inputs to soil and of SOM decomposition rates.},

  abstract = {During the decomposition process of soil organic carbon (SOC), microbial products such as microbial necromass and microbial metabolites may form an important stable carbon (C) pool, called microbially derived C, which has different decomposition patterns from plant-derived C. However, current Earth System Models do not simulate this microbially derived C pool separately. Here, we incorporated the microbial necromass pool to the first-order kinetic model and the Michaelis–Menten model, respectively, and validated model behaviors against previous observation data from the decomposition experiments of 13C-labeled necromass. Our models showed better performance than existing models and the Michaelis–Menten model was better than the first-order kinetic model. Microbial necromass C was estimated to be 10–27\% of total SOC in the study soils by our models and therefore should not be ignored. This study provides a novel modification to process-based models for better simulation of soil organic C under the context of global changes.},

  abstract = {Soil organic carbon (SOC) in agricultural lands is vital for global food production and greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation. Accurate quantification of the change in SOC stocks at regional or national scales, which depends heavily on reliable spatiotemporal carbon (C) input data, remains a big challenge. Here we use the process-based RothC model to estimate change in SOC stocks across Canada for 1971 to 2015, based on calculated annual C flows between cropland and livestock sectors. Total C input to 0–20 cm soils from crops, manure, and biosolids in Canada increased by 81\% from 1971 to 2015, which shifted Canadian agricultural lands from a CO2 source before 1990 (−1.1 Tg C yr−1) to a small sink during 1990–2005 (4.6 Tg C yr−1), and a larger sink thereafter (10.6 Tg C yr−1). The increasing trend of SOC stocks is mainly driven by the increases in crop yield; the enhanced C sink since 2005 reflects increasing C input largely driven by the increasing area and yield of canola. SOC sequestration showed a potential to offset \textasciitilde 34\% or more of agricultural GHG emission since 1990. Increasing crop yields and adopting crop mixes that input proportionately more below-ground C, such as canola and oat, showed potential additional opportunity to sequester SOC, estimated at 1.7 Tg C yr−1 for 2016–2030 in Canada. This study illustrates that SOC sequestration is driven largely by plant C inputs, and shows that agronomic measures which augment C input through crop choices and yield-enhancing practices can profoundly benefit climate mitigation strategies.},

  abstract = {The Rothamsted Carbon Model (RothC), models the turnover of soil organic carbon (C) in non-waterlogged topsoils. It requires only easily obtainable inputs, and has been widely and successfully used in many regions of the world. However, it has been shown to have limitations when used to predict soil C dynamics in semiarid areas, where unrealistically high C inputs have been required to obtain good simulations. Soils of semiarid regions, highly vulnerable to soil C depletion, could represent a sink of C and become economically valuable in the C credit market. Hence, we introduced modifications to RothC with the aim of improving the prediction of soil C dynamics for semiarid regions. Modifications made were: i) the minimum value of the rate modifying factor for moisture was changed from 0.2 to 0.15 and 0.10 (indicated with the suffix 20, 15 and 10, respectively, in the name of the model); ii) the maximum soil moisture deficit was increased and the hydrological constants (field capacity, wilting point and hygroscopic water) were calculated using pedotransfer function by van Genuchten (1980) (RothC20, RothC15, and RothC10); and iii) soils that were bare were allowed to dry out more than in the current version of RothC (RothC\_N, RothC20\_N, RothC15\_N, and RothC10\_N).},

Testing for soil carbon saturation behavior in agricultural soils receiving long-term manure amendments. Can. J. Soil Sci. 94: 281Á294. Agricultural soils are typically depleted in soil organic matter compared with their undisturbed counterparts, thus reducing their fertility. Organic amendments, particularly manures, provide the opportunity to restore soil organic matter stocks, improve soil fertility and potentially sequester atmospheric carbon (C). The application of the soil C saturation theory can help identify soils with large C storage potentials. The goal of this study was to test whether soil C saturation can be observed in various soil types in agricultural ecosystems receiving long-term manure amendments. Seven long-term agricultural field experiments from China and Canada were selected for this study. Manure amendments increased C concentrations in bulk soil, particulate organic matter'sand, and silt'clay fractions in all the experiments. The increase in C concentrations of silt'clay did not fit the asymptotic regression as a function of C inputs better than the linear regression, indicating that silt'clay did not exhibit C saturation behavior. However, 44\% of calculated C loading values for silt'clay were greater than the presumed maximal C loading, suggesting that this maximum may be greater than 1 mg C m(2 for many soils. The influences of soil mineral surface properties on C concentrations of silt'clay fractions were site specific. Fine soil particles did not exhibit C saturation behavior likely because current C inputs were insufficient to fill the large C saturation deficits of intensely cultivated soils, suggesting these soils may continue to act as sinks for atmospheric C.},

  abstract = {One of the most important terrestrial pools for carbon (C) storage and exchange with atmospheric CO2 is soil organic carbon (SOC). Following the advent of large-scale cultivation, this long-term balance was disrupted and increased amounts of SOC were exposed to oxidation and loss as atmospheric CO2. The result was a dramatic decrease in SOC. If amounts of C entering the soil exceed that lost to the atmosphere by oxidation, SOC increases. Such an increase can result from practices that include improved: (1) tillage management and cropping systems, (2) management to increase amount of land cover, and (3) ef®cient use of production inputs, e.g. nutrients and water. Among the most important contributors is conservation tillage (i.e., no-till, ridge-till, and mulch-tillage) whereby higher levels of residue cover are maintained than for conventional-tillage. Gains in amount of land area under conservation tillage between 1989 and 1998 are encouraging because of their contributions to soil and water conservation and for their potential to sequester SOC. Other important contributors are crop residue and biomass management and fallow reduction. Collectively, tillage management and cropping systems in the US are estimated to have the potential to sequester 30±105 million metric tons of carbon (MMTC) yrÀ1. Two important examples of management strategies whereby land cover is increased include crop rotations with winter cover crops and the conservation reserve program (CRP). Such practices enhance SOC sequestration by increasing the amount and time during which the land is covered by growing plants. Crop rotations, winter cover crops, and the CRP combined have the potential to sequester 14±29 MMTC yrÀ1. Biomass production is increased by ef®cient use of production inputs. Optimum fertility levels and water availability in soils can directly affect quantity of crop residues produced for return to the soil and for SOC sequestration. Nutrient inputs and supplemental irrigation are estimated to have the potential to sequester 11±30 MMTC yrÀ1. In the future, it is important to acquire an improved understanding of SOC sequestration processes, the ability to make quantitative estimates of rates of SOC sequestration, and technology to enhance these rates in an energy- and input-ef®cient manner. Adoption of improved tillage practices and cropping systems, increased land cover, and ef®cient use of nutrient and water inputs are examples where such information is necessary.

  abstract = {Current global mitigation ambition up to 2030 under the Paris Agreement, reflected in the National Determined Contributions (NDCs), is insufficient to achieve the agreement’s 1.5 ◦C long-term temperature limit. As governments are preparing new and updated NDCs for 2020, the question as to how much collective improvement is achieved is a pivotal one for the credibility of the international climate regime. The recent Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5 ◦C by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has assessed a wide range of scenarios that achieve the 1.5 ◦C limit. Those pathways are characterised by a substantial increase in near-term action and total greenhouse gas (GHG) emission levels about 50 \% lower than what is implied by current NDCs. Here we assess the outcomes of different scenarios of NDC updating that fall short of achieving this 1.5 ◦C benchmark. We find that incremental improvements in reduction targets, even if achieved globally, are insufficient to align collective ambition with the goals of the Paris Agreement. We provide estimates for global mean temperature increase by 2100 for different incremental NDC update scenarios and illustrate climate impacts under those median scenarios for extreme temperature, long-term sea-level rise and economic damages for the most vulnerable countries. Under the assumption of maintaining ambition as reflected in current NDCs up to 2100 and beyond, we project a reduction in the gross domestic product (GDP) in tropical countries of around 60 \% compared to a no-climate-change scenario and median long-term sea-level rise of close to 2 m in 2300. About half of these impacts can be avoided by limiting warming to 1.5 ◦C or below. Scenarios of more incremental NDC improvements do not lead to comparable reductions in climate impacts. An increase in aggregated NDC ambition of big emitters by 33 \% in 2030 does not reduce presented climate impacts by more than about half compared to limiting warming to 1.5 ◦C. Our results underscore that a transformational increase in 2030 ambition is required to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement and avoid the worst impacts of climate change.},

Yet, it remains unclear which of these factors are the dominant predictors of observed SOC stocks, globally and within biomes, and how the role of these predictors varies between observations and process-based models. Here we use global observations and an ensemble of soil biogeochemical models to quantify the emergent importance of key state factors – namely, mean annual temperature, net primary productivity, and soil mineralogy – in explaining biome- to global-scale variation in SOC stocks. We use a machine-learning approach to disentangle the role of covariates and elucidate individual relationships with SOC, without imposing expected relationships               a priori               . While we observe qualitatively similar relationships between SOC and covariates in observations and models, the magnitude and degree of non-linearity vary substantially among the models and observations. Models appear to overemphasize the importance of temperature and primary productivity (especially in forests and herbaceous biomes, respectively), while observations suggest a greater relative importance of soil minerals. This mismatch is also evident globally. However, we observe agreement between observations and model outputs in select individual biomes – namely, temperate deciduous forests and grasslands, which both show stronger relationships of SOC stocks with temperature and productivity, respectively. This approach highlights biomes with the largest uncertainty and mismatch with observations for targeted model improvements. Understanding the role of dominant SOC controls, and the discrepancies between models and observations, globally and across biomes, is essential for improving and validating process representations in soil and ecosystem models for projections under novel future conditions.},

An incubation experiment was, therefore, conducted for 4 weeks under controlled temperature conditions (30°C) to identify those potential organic amendments that might improve the quality of a Vertisol. Twelve organic amendments were investigated: cotton gin trash from three sources, cattle manure from two sources, green waste compost, chicken manure from three sources including a commercial product, biosolids and two commercial liquefied vermicomposts. Except for the biosolids, no other organic amendments had any effect on soil microbial biomass and respiration. Compared with NO3-N levels in the control, there was a 50\% decrease in soil amended with 10 t ha–1 green waste compost (65 µg g–1). The three different types of chicken manures increased the NO3-N concentration from 75\% (228 µg g–1) to 226\% (424 µg g–1) over the control. Approximate recovery of P added by the amendment as resin-extractable soil P was 53\% for cattle manure and 39\% for chicken manure. Application of cattle manure resulted in a 22\% increase in soil-exchangeable K over levels found in control. Organic amendments application also resulted in a significant increase in exchangeable Na concentration. Some of the organic wastes, viz. cotton gin trash (10 t ha–1), cattle manure (10 t ha–1), biosolids (10 t ha–1) and composted chicken manure (3 t ha–1) have value as a source of nutrients to soil and hence showed potential to improve Vertisol properties.},

  abstract = {The ability to estimate net N mineralization from C decomposition data has the potential to improve our understanding of N dynamics in soil systems. It was the objective of this study to study this relationship using substrates with varying decomposition rates and C/ N ratios. Five substrates including sewage sludge, alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.), clover (Trifolium sp.), bermudagrass [Cynodon dactylon (L.) Pers.j and ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam.) were incubated in Crowley silt loam (Typic Albaqualfs) or Captina silt loam (Typic Fragiudults) soil at known soil temperatures and moistures. Concurrent CO2 evolution and soil inorganic N concentrations were measured periodically. A significant linear relationship between N mineralization and CO: evolution was found experimentally for each substrate. A computer simulation model was developed which used first order kinetics for conversion of substrate C to CO2. Substrate C mineralization rate constants, substrate C/N ratios and microbial efficiency were primary inputs, while substrate, biomass, and soil organic matter were the major compartments of the model. Microbial efficiency was defined for any C pool undergoing decomposition as the ratio of assimilated C to assimilated C plus dissimilated C. An important feature of the approach was the introduction of a fraction with a C/N ratio of protein that decomposed very rapidly for those substrates where initial N mineralization was large while CO2 evolution was small. Model predictions of both CO2 evolution and net N mineralization were in good agreement with experimental results.},

This study was conducted to evaluate the emission of soil CO2, N2O, and CH4 and soil C and N indicators four years after manure and compost application had stopped. Experimental plots were treated with annual synthetic N fertilizer (FRT), annual and biennial manure (MN1 and MN2, respectively), and compost (CP1 and CP2, respectively) from 1992 to 1995 based on removal of 151 kg N haϪ1 yrϪ1 by continuous corn (Zea mays L.). The control (CTL) plots received no input. After 1995, only the FRT plots received N fertilizer in the spring of 1999. In 1999, the emissions of CO2 were similar between control and other treatments. The average annual carbon input in the CTL and FRT plots were similar to soil CO2–C emission (4.4 and 5.1 Mg C haϪ1 yrϪ1, respectively). Manure and compost resulted in positive C and N balances in the soil four years after application. Fluxes of CH4–C and N2O-N were nearly zero, which indicated that the residual effects of manure and compost four years after application had no negative influence on soil C and N storage and global warming. Residual effects of compost and manure resulted in 20 to 40\% higher soil microbial biomass C, 42 to 74\% higher potentially mineralizable N, and 0.5 unit higher pH compared with the FRT treatment. Residual effects of manure and compost on CO2, N2O, and CH4 emissions were minimal and their benefits on soil C and N indicators were more favorable than that of N fertilizer.},

The composting material obtained after 15 d in trenches and at different times during the maturation phase (i.e. 80, 180 and 270 d) were analyzed. We found that the material collected at the end of the active phase was inadequate to be applied to soil as organic amendment due to its high content of NHþ4 , its high level of phytotoxicity and the low degree of organic matter stability. After a maturation period of 80 d, the stability of the sample increased. This was shown by a reduction in the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) content and NHþ4 concentration and also by a reduction in the microbial activity and biomass; however, 180 d of composting were not sufficient to reduce the phytotoxicity to levels consistent for a safe soil application. Among the various parameters studied, the change in DOC with composting time gave a good indication of stability.},

There were losses of N in poultry waste and water hyacinth with the effect an initial increase in C:N ratio was observed which decreased later on due to decomposition. The activities of cellulase, xylanase and protease were maximum between 30 and 60 days of composting in various wastes. Similar trend was observed with respect to mesophilic bacterial and fungal population. Various quality parameters like C:N ratio, water soluble C (WSC), CO2 evolution and level of humic substances were compared after 90 day composting. There was statistically significant correlation between C:N ratio and CO2 evolution, WSC and humic substances. Significant correlation between CO2 evolved and level of humic substances was also observed. The study shows that no single parameter can be taken as an index of compost maturity. However, C:N ratio and CO2 evolved from finished compost can be taken as the most reliable indices of compost maturity.},

  abstract = {Legume-based cropping systems could help to increase crop productivity and soil organic matter levels, thereby enhancing soil quality, as well as having the additional benefit of sequestering atmospheric C. To evaluate the effects of 35 yr of maize monoculture and legume-based cropping on soil C levels and residue retention, we measured organic C and               13               C natural abundance in soils under: fertilized and unfertilized maize (Zea mays L.), both in monoculture and legume-based [maize-oat (Avena sativa L.)-alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.)-alfalfa] rotations; fertilized and unfertilized systems of continuous grass (Poa pratensis L.); and under forest. Solid state               13               C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) was used to chemically characterize the organic matter in plant residues and soils. Soils (70-cm depth) under maize cropping had about 30-40\% less C, and those under continuous grass had about 16\% less C, than those under adjacent forest. Qualitative differences in crop residues were important in these systems, because quantitative differences in net primary productivity and C inputs in the different agroecosystems did not account for observed differences in total soil C. Cropping sequence (i.e., rotation or monoculture) had a greater effect on soil C levels than application of fertilizer. The difference in soil C levels between rotation and monoculture maize systems was about 20 Mg C ha               -1               . The effects of fertilization on soil C were small (\textasciitilde 6 Mg C ha               -1               ), and differences were observed only in the monoculture system. The NMR results suggest that the chemical composition of organic matter was little affected by the nature of crop residues returned to the soil. The total quantity of maize-derived soil C was different in each system, because the quantity of maize residue returned to the soil was different; hence the maize-derived soil C ranged from 23 Mg ha               -1               in the fertilized and 14 Mg ha               -1               in the unfertilized monoculture soils (i.e., after 35 maize crops) to 6-7 Mg ha               -1               in both the fertilized and unfertilized legume-based rotation soils (i.e., after eight maize crops). The proportion of maize residue C returned to the soil and retained as soil organic C (i.e., Mg maize-derived soil C/Mg maize residue) was about 14\% for all maize cropping systems. The quantity of C3-C below the plow layer in legume-based rotation was 40\% greater than that in monoculture and about the same as that under either continuous grass or forest. The soil organic matter below the plow layer in soil under the legume-based rotation appeared to be in a more biologically resistant form (i.e., higher aromatic C content) compared with that under monoculture. The retention of maize residue C as soil organic matter was four to five times greater below the plow layer than that within the plow layer. We conclude that residue quality plays a key role in increasing the retention of soil C in agroecosystems and that soils under legume-based rotation tend to be more “preservative” of residue C inputs, particularly from root inputs, than soils under monoculture.

Soil Sci. 74 367-385. Soil quality is a composite measure of both a soil's ability to funct-ion and how welt it functions, relative to a specific use. Soil quality can beassessed using a minimum data set comprisingioil attributes such as texture, organic matter, pH, bulk density, and rooting depth. Soit organic matter has particular significa-nce for soil quality as it can influenie many different soil properties including other attributes of the minimum data set. Asiessment of soil organii matter is a valuable step towards identifying the overall quality of a soil and may be so informative as to be included in minimum data sets used to evaluate the world's soils. In this review, soil organic matter is considered to encompass a set of attributes rather than being a single entity. Included among the attributes and discussed here are total soil organiciarbon and nitrogen, light fraction and macroorganic (particulate) mattei, mineralizable carbon and nitrogen, microbial biomass, soil carbohydrates and enzymes. These attributes are involved in various soil processes, such as those related to nutrient storage, biological activity, and soil structure, and can be used to establish different minimum data sets for the evaluation of soil organic matter quality.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Manure application to agricultural soils is widely considered as a source of nutrients and a method of maintaining levels of soil organic carbon (SOC) to mitigate climate change. At present, it is still unclear which factors are responsible for the SOC stock dynamics. Therefore, we analyzed the relationship between SOC stock changes and site characteristics, soil properties, experiment characteristics and manure characteristics. Overall, we included 101 studies with a total of 592 treatments. On average, the application of manure on agricultural soils increased SOC stocks by 35.4\%, corresponding to 10.7~Mg~ha               −1               . Manure applications in conventional tillage systems led to higher SOC stocks (+\,2.2~Mg~ha               −1               ) than applications under reduced tillage. Soil organic carbon increase upon manure application was higher in soils under non-tropical climate conditions (+\,2.7~Mg~ha               −1               ) compared to soils under sub-tropical climate. Larger SOC increases after manure application were achieved in intermediate and shallow topsoils (in 0–15~cm by 9.5~Mg~ha               −1               and in 16–20~cm by 13.6~Mg~ha               −1               ), but SOC stocks were also increased in deeper soils ({$>$}\,20~cm 4.6~Mg~ha               −1               ), regardless of the tillage intensity. The highest relative SOC increase (+\,48\%) was achieved if the initial SOC was below 1\% but the absolute SOC increased with increasing initial SOC. Clay soils showed higher SOC increase rates compared to sandy soils (+\,3.1~Mg~ha               −1               ). Acidic soils showed comparable relative effects but a higher stock difference than neutral (+\,5.1~Mg~ha               −1               ) and alkaline soils (+\,5.1~Mg~ha               −1               ). The application of farmyard-, cattle- and pig manure showed the highest SOC increases (50\%, 32\% and 41\%, respectively), while green manure and straw showed only minor effects. If manure applications were combined with additional mineral fertilizer, the SOC increases were higher (+\,1.7~Mg~ha               −1               ) compared to manure alone. Higher applied amounts generally led to higher SOC stocks. However the annually applied amount is only important under conventional tillage, non-tropical climate conditions, and pH-neutral as well as SOC-rich or SOC-depleted soils and if no additional mineral fertilization is applied. Further studies should focus on the SOC dynamics under tropical climate conditions and factors influencing a potential carbon saturation. In both cases, the number of data was too small. For this reason, additional field studies should be conducted primarily in the tropics. On the other hand, long-term field trials should be re-assessed or newly established to specifically investigate potential saturation effects and long-term ({$>$}\,20~years) fertilizer effects and carbon sequestration.},

  abstract = {Arable land can be either a source or a sink for atmospheric carbon dioxide depending on its management. It is important to assess changes in soil organic carbon (SOC) under future climate change scenarios using models at regional or global scales. This paper aims to calibrate the RothC model on non-waterlogged soils in northern China to obtain the necessary model input parameters for later use in large-scale studies. Data sets from three long-term experiments in northern China were used to evaluate the performance of the RothC soil carbon turnover model. The plant carbon input rate, an important model input parameter, was calibrated using experimental data under typical rotation systems with different fertilization. The results showed that RothC accurately simulated the changes in SOC across a wide area of northern China (northeast, north, and northwest China. The modelling error expressed as root mean square error for four treatments (nil, manure, fertilizer, fertilizer + manure) at three sites were less than 20.2\%, and less than 7.8\% if occasional extreme measured values were omitted. The simulation biases expressed as M (i.e. relative error) for all treatments at the three sites were non-significant. Observed trends in SOC included a decrease for the nil (no fertilizer or manure) treatment and an increase for the treatments which received both manure and fertilizers. The experiments also indicated that manures applied at an appropriate rate were more effective in increasing or maintaining SOC than fertilizers which were more effective in increasing crop yields.},

However, its feedbacks to climate warming and underlying microbial mechanisms are still poorly understood. Here we show that the temperature sensitivity of soil microbial respiration (               Q               10               ) in a temperate grassland ecosystem persistently decreases by 12.0\,±\,3.7\% across 7 years of warming. Also, the shifts of microbial communities play critical roles in regulating thermal adaptation of soil respiration. Incorporating microbial functional gene abundance data into a microbially-enabled ecosystem model significantly improves the modeling performance of soil microbial respiration by 5–19\%, and reduces model parametric uncertainty by 55–71\%. In addition, modeling analyses show that the microbial thermal adaptation can lead to considerably less heterotrophic respiration (11.6\,±\,7.5\%), and hence less soil C loss. If such microbially mediated dampening effects occur generally across different spatial and temporal scales, the potential positive feedback of soil microbial respiration in response to climate warming may be less than previously predicted.},

  abstract = {The critical period of weed control for crops grown under conventional tillage systems has been well studied, and the results generated by these studies have been proven to be very useful in developing ecologically and economically sound weed management practices. However, these management systems may not be directly applicable under no-till situations because the species composition, total amount, and temporal pattern of seedling emergence change substantially with tillage. The objective of this study was to identify the critical period of weed control for soybean and corn in fields that had been under no-till management for 1 yr. Although estimates of the critical period for a crop vary from year to year and site to site, some interesting comparisons can be made between no-till and conventional tillage. The start of the critical period in no-till corn was stable, usually beginning at the six-leaf stage. The end of the critical period was more variable ranging from the 9- to 13-leaf stage. The critical period for corn under no-till conditions tended to start and end earlier than under conventional tillage practices. In soybean, we were unable to identify a critical period at one of the sites. At the other location (sandy loam soil), the critical period was estimated to begin at the first or second node developmental stage, whereas the end was determined to be at the RI stage (early flowering). The critical period in soybean was longer than that observed under conventional tillage. Nomenclature: Corn, Zea mays L. 'Pioneer 3573'; soybean, Glycine max (L.) Merr. 'Northrup King 2492'.

  abstract = {Monitoring soil carbon content and pools and associated enzyme activities has become an important area of research in terms of the carbon cycle in agricultural lands in order to infer factors regulating soil carbon sequestration. Pig slurry (PS) is considered as a source of organic matter and nutrients for crop production. In recent years, because of the cost of conventional feed applications, manufacturers have preferred liquid feeding diets with decreases of 10–25\% in production costs. Furthermore, physical and chemical filtration of PS by new techniques may prevent soil degradation and reduce the negative effects of PS, such as high salt, pathogen, and heavy metal contents. This research aimed to assess the effect of the application of raw pig slurry (R) and treated pig slurry (T) (derived from physical and chemical separation processes) from liquid (L) and solid (S) feeding diets on different soil organic carbon pools and enzyme activities in a sandy loam soil under a rainfed barley cropping system for two years. The solid diet consisted of maize/soya bean, tubers and roots, and supplementary vitamins and minerals. The liquid diet consisted of dairy products such as fresh whey, concentrated cheese or yogurt, skim milk powder, and beer by-products such as brewer's yeast. As a general pattern, the addition of the different types of PS (R or T) had no significant effect on most soil properties, except for microbial biomass C (Cmic), which increased with R. However, the type of diet did have a significant effect on most properties, both for R or T slurries, suggesting that this is more of a determinant factor in explaining changes in soil than the type of pig slurry. Solid diet favors the significant increase of soil organic carbon and arylesterase activity, suggesting higher stabilization of the organic compounds provided by the PS. However, the liquid diet contributed to increasing soluble C and Cmic, suggesting higher availability of nutrients and C sources. Hence, the use of treated pig slurry has no detrimental effect on organic carbon dynamics compared to raw pig slurry and can be suggested as an alternative to reduce the environmental impact, prevent soil pollution, and ensure sustainability.},

  abstract = {Carbon and N losses reduce the agronomic value of compost and contribute to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This study investigated GHG emissions during composting of straw-bedded manure (SBM) and wood chip-bedded manure (WBM). For SBM, dry matter (DM) loss was 301 kg MgϪ1, total carbon (TC) loss was 174 kg MgϪ1, and total nitrogen (TN) loss was 8.3 kg MgϪ1. These correspond to 30.1\% of initial DM, 52.8\% of initial TC, and 41.6\% of initial TN. For WBM, DM loss was 268 kg MgϪ1, TC loss was 154 kg MgϪ1, and TN loss was 1.40 kg MgϪ1, corresponding to 26.5, 34.5, and 11.8\% of initial amounts. Most C was lost as CO2 with CH4 accounting for Ͻ6\%. However, the net contribution to greenhouse gas emissions was greater for CH4 since it is 21 times more effective at trapping heat than CO2. Nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions were 0.077 kg N MgϪ1 for SBM and 0.084 kg N MgϪ1 for WBM, accounting for 1 to 6\% of total N loss. Total GHG emissions as CO2–C equivalent were not significantly different between SBM (368.4 Ϯ 18.5 kg MgϪ1) and WBM (349.2 Ϯ 24.3 kg MgϪ1). However, emission of 368.4 kg C MgϪ1 (CO2–C equivalent) was greater than the initial TC content (330.5 kg MgϪ1) of SBM, raising the question of the net benefits of composting on C sequestration. Further study is needed to evaluate the impact of composting on overall GHG emissions and C sequestration and to fully investigate livestock manure management options.},

  abstract = {Zusammenfassung Improving manure management to benefit both agricultural production and the environment requires a thorough understanding of the long-term effects of applied manure on soil properties. This paper examines the effect of 25 annual solid cattle manure applications on soil organic carbon (OC), total N (TN), and KCl-extractable NO3-N and NH4-N under both non-irrigated and irrigated conditions. After 25 annual manure applications, OC and TN contents increased significantly with the rate of manure application at the top two sampling depths (0±15 cm and 15± 30 cm), and the increases were not affected by the irrigation treatment. The NO3 content increased at all sampling depths with greater increases observed under non-irrigated conditions, while NH4 content was not affected by manure application rates or the irrigation treatment. The changes in OC and TN at the surface (0±15 cm) and 15±30 cm depth were dependent on the cumulative weight of manure added over the years. The relationships between cumulative manure OC added and soil OC content and between cumulative manure TN added and soil TN content were linear and not affected by the irrigation treatment. For every ton of manure OC added, soil OC increased by 0.181 g kg±1 in the topsoil (0±15 cm). Similarly, for every ton of manure TN added, surface soil TN increased by 0.192 g kg±1. The linear relationship between manure C added and soil C content suggests that the soil had a high capacity for short-term C sequestration. However, the total amount of NO3-N in the soil profile (0±150 cm) was affected by both the manure application rates and the irrigation treatment. A large amount of NO3 accumulated in the soil, especially under non-irrigated conditions. The extremely high level of NO3 in the soil increases the potential risk of surface and groundwater pollution and losses to atmosphere as N2O.},

  abstract = {Understanding the form-specific long-term effects of manure (liquid, solid, and composted) application on soil P is essential for nutrient management planning. This 8-yr study aimed to quantify changes in soil test P (STP, Olsen-P) with application of three forms of swine manure compared with inorganic fertilizer and to calculate the manure P source availability coefficient (PSAC) as the ratio of the specific manure form to inorganic P in providing crop P availability. The STP content increased linearly with both total and net P addition at the surface (0–15 cm) and subsurface (15–30 cm) soil depths, regardless of P source.

  abstract = {Understanding the form-specific long-term effects of manure (liquid, solid, and composted) application on soil P is essential for nutrient management planning. This 8-yr study aimed to quantify changes in soil test P (STP, Olsen-P) with application of three forms of swine manure compared with inorganic fertilizer and to calculate the manure P source availability coefficient (PSAC) as the ratio of the specific manure form to inorganic P in providing crop P availability. The STP content increased linearly with both total and net P addition at the surface (0–15 cm) and subsurface (15–30 cm) soil depths, regardless of P source. The slope of STP vs. total or net P addition in the surface layer was steeper for liquid than for solid manure, whereas in the subsurface layer, composted manure showed a greater slope than either liquid or solid manure. The amount of applied P required to increase STP by one unit in the surface layer was 19.9, 15.7, 31.6, and 20.9 kg P ha–1 for inorganic fertilizer and liquid, solid, and composted manure, respectively.

  abstract = {Traditional methods to evaluate the stability and maturity of organic wastes and composting matrices are laborious, time-consuming and generate laboratory chemical wastes. This study focused on the development of partial least square (PLS) regression models for the prediction of the stability and maturity of compostbased substrates based on Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The following parameters, selected as conventional maturity indexes, were modeled and used as dataset: dissolved organic carbon (DOC), C/N and NH4+/NO3− ratios, cation exchange capacity (CEC), degree of polymerization (DP), percentage of humic acid (PHA), humification index (HI) and humification ratio (HR). Models were obtained by using data from a wide range of compost based growing media of diverse origin and composition, including 4 commercially available substrates and 11 substrates prepared in our facilities with varying proportions of different organic wastes. The PLS models presented correlation coefficient of calibration (R2cal) close to 0.90 and correlation coefficient (R2) of cross validation (R2cv) presented acceptable values (N 0.6), ranging from 0.67 (HR) to 0.92 (C/N). The good performance of the method was also confirmed by the low correlation obtained from the Yrandomization test. R2 for test samples (R2pred) ranged from 0.66 (C/N) to 0.97 (HI) confirming the good correlation between measured and PLS predicted maturity indexes. FTIR spectroscopy combined with PLS regression represents, after modeling process, a fast and alternative method to assess substrate maturity and stability with reduction of time, lower generation of laboratory chemical wastes residues and lower cost per sample than conventional chemical methods. All models adjusted for maturity indexes are predictive, robust and did not present chance correlation.},

  abstract = {Two different agricultural tillage practices were used to study how changes in the structure of the soil-litter system affected litter decomposition rates, microbial community composition, and soil organic matter dynamics. Surface straw placement results in spatial separation of carbon-rich litter (C:N ratio 80:1) and mineralized soil nitrogen. In contrast, when the litter is plowed into the soil, straw carbon and soil nitrogen are in intimate contact. Our field studies in Colorado showed that fungal biomass in surfacestraw treatments was 144\% of that in the incorporated-straw treatments, probably because fungi, with their extensive hyphal networks, are able to utilize both the surface straw carbon and the available soil nitrogen. Field studies using '4C-labeled wheat straw showed that a greater proportion of added 14C was retained in the surface-straw treatment than in the incorporated-straw treatment. Maximum net N immobilization was higher and litter decomposition was slower in the surface straw than in the incorporated straw placements both with and without experimental nitrogen addition. Slower litter decomposition of the surface litter may contribute to reduced soil organic matter losses. Soil organic matter losses may also be reduced in no-till systems as a result of the increase in the ratio of fungal to bacterial activity because of the greater growth efficiency of fungi and the accumulation of carbon in the less decomposable fungal biomass. The surface placement of straw in no-till agriculture allowed management of microclimate and microbial populations so that losses of soil organic matter and nutrients were minimized.},

  abstract = {One of the main options for greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation identified by the IPCC is the sequestration of carbon in soils. Since the breaking of agricultural land in most regions, the carbon stocks have been depleted to such an extent, that they now represent a potential sink for CO2 removal from the atmosphere. Improved management will however, be required to increase the inputs of organic matter in the top soil and/or decrease decomposition rates. In this paper we use data from selected regions to explore the global potential for carbon sequestration in arable soils. While realising that C sequestration is not limited to the selected regions, we have, however, focussed our review on two regions: (i) Canadian Prairies and (ii) The Tropics. In temperate regions, management changes for an increase in C involve increase in cropping frequency (reducing bare fallow), increasing use of forages in crop rotations, reducing tillage intensity and frequency, better crop residue management, and adopting agroforestry. In the tropics, agroforestry remains the primary method by which sequestration rates may be significantly increased. Increases in soil C may be achieved through improved fertility of cropland/pasture; on extensive systems with shifting cultivation cropped fallows and cover crops may be beneficial, and adopting agro forestry or foresting marginal cropland is also an alternative. In addition, in the tropics it is imperative to reduce the clearing of forests for conversion to cropland. Some regional analyses of soil C sequestration and sequestration potential have been performed, mainly for temperate industrialized North America where the majority of research pertaining to C sequestration has been carried out. More research is needed, especially for the Tropics, to more accurately capture the impact of region-specific interactions between climate, soil, and management of resources on C sequestration, which are lost in global level assessments. By itself, C sequestration in agricultural soils can make only modest contributions (3–6\% of fossil fuel contributions) to mitigation of overall greenhouse gas emissions. However, effective mitigation policies will not be based on any single ‘magic bullet’ solutions, but rather on many modest reductions which are economically efficient and which confer additional benefits to society. In this context, soil C sequestration is a significant mitigation option.},

Laboratory results showed that the extractability of elements varied considerably with the type of composted manure. Total C varied in the order cow {$>$} goat {$>$} buffalo {$>$} poultry {$>$} camel while total N was in the order buffalo {$>$} poultry {$>$} cow {$>$} camel {$>$} goat.

We used two rotations from the Breton Classical Plots at Breton, Canada, on a Typic Cryoboralf: (i) wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)–fallow (WF) and (ii) wheat–oat (Avena sativa L.)–barley (Hordeum vulgare L.)–hay (primarily alfalfa, Medicago sativa L.)–hay (WOBHH), in factorial combination with three fertility levels: no added fertilizer [Nil], N-P-K-S fertilizers [F], and farmyard manure [M]. Net aboveground C productivity (NAGCP, kg haϪ1 yrϪ1) averaged 576 in WF–Nil and 1078 in WF–F and SOC decreased in both, but NAGCP averaged 1208 in WF–M, where SOC increased. A NAGCP of 853 in WOBHH–Nil maintained SOC, while both 1831 in WOBHH–F and 1714 in WOBHH–M increased SOC. After 51 yr, WOBHH–M had 25 Mg haϪ1 more SOC than did WF–Nil. Because of contrasting decay rates and root/shoot ratios, C input needed to maintain the original SOC was twofold greater in WF than in WOBHH, which required a fourfold increase in NAGCP to attain these inputs. A three-compartment model fitted to the data suggested loss of C from the active compartments and gain of C by the passive compartments. Inputs of C that maintained SOC over 51 yr would lead to a steady state of 2.9 times more C than in 1939, and 26\% higher than the native SOC content. Return of 30\% of the crop C as manure would sustain SOC sequestration in all WOBHH rotations with NAGCP Ͼ 400 kg haϪ1 yrϪ1 and in those WF rotations with NAGCP Ͼ 1000 kg haϪ1 yrϪ1.},

  abstract = {Agroecosystems rely on inputs of nitrogen (N) to sustain productivity. But added N can leak into adjacent environments, affecting the health of other ecosystems and their inhabitants. Worries about global warming have cast further attention on the N cycle in farmlands because farms are a main source of N2O, and because carbon sequestration, proposed to help reduce CO2 loads, requires a build-up of N. Our objective was to estimate, as an illustrative example, the net N balance of Canadian agroecosystems in 1996 and then infer some hypotheses about the routes of N loss, their magnitude, and ways of reducing them. We defined agroecosystems as all agricultural lands in Canada including soil to 1 m depth and all biota, except humans. Only net flows of N across those boundaries were counted in our balance – all others represent internal cycling. Based on our estimates, about 2.35 Tg N entered Canadian agroecosystems from biological fixation, fertilizers, and atmospheric deposition (excluding re-deposited NH3). In the same year, about 1.03 Tg N were exported in crop products and 0.19 Tg were exported in animals and animal products. Consequently, N inputs exceed exports in products by about 1.13 Tg, a surplus that is either accumulating in agroecosystems or lost to the environment. Because potential soil organic matter gains can account for only a small part of the surplus N, most is probably lost to air or groundwater. Our finding, that N losses amount to almost half of N added, concurs with field experiments that show crop recovery of added N in a given year is often not more than 60\%. Better management may reduce the fraction lost somewhat but, because N in ecosystems eventually cycles back to N2, substantive gains in efficiency may not come easily. As well as trying to reduce losses, research might also focus on steering losses directly to N2, away from more harmful intermediates. If some of the ‘missing N’ can be assimilated into organic matter, agricultural soils in Canada may need little added N to achieve C sequestration targets.},

  abstract = {Soil samples collected from four of the Rothamsted long-term field experiments over the last 100yr were used to follow the effects of management on soil organic matter content. The experimental sites were: Broadbalk and Geescroft Wildernesses, both on old arable land that had been fenced off in the early 1880s and allowed to revert naturally to deciduous woodland; the unmanured plot in the Rothamsted Park Grass Continuous Hay Experiment, started in 1856;the unmanured and one of the NPK plots in the Broadbalk Continuous Wheat Experiment started in 1843. Total C, radiocarbon and (in some cases) soil microbial biomass C were measured in stored and contemporary soil samples. The current Rothamsted model for the turnover of organic C in soil was then used to calculate how the organic C content of the topsoils from the four sites would change with time for a range of annual inputs. The inputs that generated the best fit to the measured values were: Broadbalk Wilderness 3.5 t C ha-’ yr-I; Geescroft Wilderness 2.5 t C ha-’ yr-‘; unmanured plot on Park Grass 3.0 t C ha-’ yr-‘; unmanured plot on Broadbalk Wheat 1.3 t C ha-’ yr-‘; NPK plot on Broadbalk Wheat 1.7 t C ha-’ yr-‘. The model also generated the radiocarbon content of soil organic C for these inputs of C, knowing the t4C content of the atmosphere over the period 1840-1985. The marked increase in the 14Ccontent of soil organic C brought about by thermonuclear testing during the 1960’s was accurately represented by the model. The quantities of soil microbial biomass (measured by fumigation-incubation) in the top 23 cm of soil from the four sites were: Broadbalk Wilderness, 1.57 t C ha-‘; Geescroft Wilderness, 0.58 t C ha-‘; unmanured plot on Park Grass, 1.62 t C ha-‘; unmanured plot on Broadbalk Wheat, 0.47 t C ha-‘; NPK plot on Broadbalk Wheat, 0.76 t C ha-‘. The values for soil microbial biomass C generated by the model for the above annual inputs agreed closely (with one exception) with the measured values.},

  abstract = {N management has the potential to mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Process-based models are promising tools for evaluating and developing management practices that may optimize sustainability goals as well as promote crop productivity. In this study, the GHG emission component of the Root Zone Water Quality Model (RZWQM2) was tested under two different types of N management and subsequently compared with the Denitrification-Decomposition (DNDC) model using measured data from a subsurface-drained field with a corn-soybean rotation in southern Ontario, Canada. Fieldmeasured data included N2O and CO2 fluxes, soil temperature, and soil moisture content from a four-year field experiment (2012 to 2015). The experiment was composed of two N treatments: inorganic fertilizer (IF), and inorganic fertilizer combined with solid cattle manure (SCM). Both models were calibrated using the data from IF and validated with SCM. Statistical results indicated that both models predicted well the soil temperature, but RZWQM2 performed better than DNDC in simulating soil water content (SWC) because DNDC lacked a heterogeneous soil profile, had shallow simulation depth, and lacked crop root density functions. Both RZWQM2 and DNDC predicted the cumulative N2O and CO2 emissions within 15\% error under all treatments, while the timing of daily CO2 emissions was more accurately predicted by RZWQM2 (RMSE = 0.43 to 0.54) than by DNDC (RMSE = 0.60 to 0.67). Modeling results for N management effects on GHG emissions showed consistency with the field measurements, indicating higher CO2 emissions under SCM than IF, higher N2O emissions under IF in corn years, but lower N2O emissions in soybean years. Overall, RZWQM2 required more experienced and intensive calibration and validation, but it provided more accurate predictions of soil hydrology and better timing of CO2 emissions than DNDC.},

  abstract = {The response of both surface runoff and subsurface drainage as affected by water table management practices in tile-drained fields is poorly documented. Widely used to simulate management effects on crop production and water quality, the Root Zone Water Quality Model (RZWQM2) has recently been equipped with a subirrigation component. Coupled with Simultaneous Heat and Water (SHAW) model to improve its hydrological responses to cold climates, the hybrid RZ-SHAW has never been tested for simulating surface runoff and subsurface drainage under controlled drainage with subirrigation system. The objective of this study was to evaluate the model performance in predicting surface runoff, subsurface tile drainage, and crop yield under regular drainage (DR) and controlled drainage with subirrigation (CDS) for the first time. The RZ-SHAW model was calibrated and validated against tile drainage, surface runoff and crop yield data collected in a tile-drained field in Harrow, Ontario from June 2008 to December 2011 under DR and CDS treatments. Despite occasional underestimation in winter and overestimation in summer, the model was performing generally satisfactorily in simulating the accumulated subsurface drainage and runoff under both DR and CDS treatments with percent bias (PBIAS) within ± 15 \%, Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient (NSE) {$>$} 0.5 and the index of agreement (IoA) {$>$} 0.75. Overall, the RZ-SHAW was capable of predicting the subsurface drainage and surface runoff under both DR and CDS treatment, and it provided reliable estimation for the impact of water table management practice on ET and crop yield, but its accuracy for simulating events of peak flow was not as precise for the CDS treatment than DR treatment.},

  abstract = {Manure application to soil has declined globally due to increased availability of mineral fertilizers. However, mineral fertilizer overuse has caused serious consequences for soil quality and the environment. We analyzed the results of 20 long-term field trials (22–32 years, start year [ranged from 1980 to 1990] to 2012) and combined this with a climate change model and soil organic carbon (SOC) model to quantify the importance of manure and mineral fertilizers for grain yield and SOC sequestration across croplands in China. During the past three decades mineral fertilizers have increased grain yield for 91–184\% but had minor impact on SOC sequestration (4–16\%). In contrast, manure applied with mineral fertilizer increased grain yield by only 6–19\% but strongly raised the SOC content (9–39\%) compared with mineral fertilizer. Modeling (to the year 2099) indicated that manure used in combination with mineral fertilizers will increase future C sequestration in soils across China by 2,086 Tg C and by 2,482 Tg C based on current net primary productivity with no climate change and on increased net primary productivity with climate change scenarios, respectively. This corresponds to an additional 43–58\% increase in C sequestration compared to mineral fertilizers only. The manure efficiency for C sequestration in soil was about 9.6\% of C input and decreased with increasing SOC content. To maintain the current SOC content (i.e., 2010), 11 t·haÀ1·yearÀ1 fresh manure or 4.8 t·haÀ1·yearÀ1 dry maize straw would be required. We conclude that the regular use of manure with mineral fertilizers is essential for the long-term dual functions of soil for food production and SOC sequestration.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Global soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks may decline with a warmer climate. However, model projections of changes in SOC due to climate warming depend on microbially-driven processes that are usually parameterized based on laboratory incubations. To assess how lab-scale incubation datasets inform model projections over decades, we optimized five microbially-relevant parameters in the Microbial-ENzyme Decomposition (MEND) model using 16 short-term glucose (6-day), 16 short-term cellulose (30-day) and 16 long-term cellulose (729-day) incubation datasets with soils from forests and grasslands across contrasting soil types. Our analysis identified consistently higher parameter estimates given the short-term versus long-term datasets. Implementing the short-term and long-term parameters, respectively, resulted in SOC loss (–8.2\,±\,5.1\% or –3.9\,±\,2.8\%), and minor SOC gain (1.8\,±\,1.0\%) in response to 5\,°C warming, while only the latter is consistent with a meta-analysis of 149 field warming observations (1.6\,±\,4.0\%). Comparing multiple subsets of cellulose incubations (i.e., 6, 30, 90, 180, 360, 480 and 729-day) revealed comparable projections to the observed long-term SOC changes under warming only on 480- and 729-day. Integrating multi-year datasets of soil incubations (e.g., {$>$} 1.5 years) with microbial models can thus achieve more reasonable parameterization of key microbial processes and subsequently boost the accuracy and confidence of long-term SOC projections.},

  abstract = {Simulating cropland soil carbon changes following a reduction in tillage intensity is necessary to determine the utility of this management practice in climate change mitigation. In instances where reduced or no tillage in­ creases soil carbon stocks, this is typically due to reduced decomposition rates of plant residues. Although some soil carbon models contain a priori decomposition rate modifiers to account for tillage regime, these are typically not calibrated to specific climatic regions, and none are currently available for the Rothamsted Carbon Model (RothC). Here, we present a modelling framework to estimate a tillage rate modifier (TRM) for the decomposition rate constants in RothC-26.3 which determine decay between soil carbon pools. We demonstrate this for northwest Europe, using published data assembled through a recent systematic review with propagation of error from input parameters throughout the framework. The small magnitude of soil carbon change following a reduction in tillage intensity in this region is reflected in our TRM estimates for no-till of 0.95, with 95\% Credible Intervals [0.91, 1.00], and reduced tillage of 0.93 [0.90, 0.97], relative to conventional high-intensity tillage with a default TRM of 1. These TRMs facilitate realistic simulation of soil carbon dynamics following a reduction of tillage intensity using RothC, and our simple, transparent, and repeatable modelling framework is suitable for application in other climatic regions using input data generalisable to the context of interest.},

The objectives of this study were to determine the extent of degradation of sorbed OM and to investigate changes in its composition during degradation. DOM of different origins was sorbed to a subsoil and incubated for 1 year. We quantified mineralized C by frequent CO2 measurements in the headspace of the incubation vessels and calculated mean residence times by a double exponential model. Mineralization of C of the corresponding DOM in solution was used as a control to estimate the extent of DOM stabilization by sorption. Changes in the composition of sorbed OM during the incubation were studied by spectroscopic (UV, fluorescence) and isotope (13C, 14C) measurements after hot-water extraction of OM.},

  abstract = {Agricultural systems are increasingly managed for improving soil carbon (C) accumulation. However, there are limits to C returns in agricultural systems that constrain soil C accumulation capacity. Increasing the efficiency of how soil microbes process C is gaining interest as an important management strategy for increasing soil C and is a key feature of soil C dynamics in many new microbial-explicit models. A higher microbial C use efficiency (CUE) may increase C storage while reducing C system losses and is a fundamental trait affecting community assembly dynamics and nutrient cycling. However, the numerous ecological unknowns influencing CUE limit our ability to effectively manage CUE in agricultural soils for greater soil C storage. In this perspective, we consider three complex drivers of agroecosystem CUE that need to be resolved to develop effective C sequestration management practices in the future: (1) the environment as an individual trait moderator versus a filter, (2) microbial community competitive and faciliatory interactions, and (3) spatiotemporal dynamics through the soil profile and across the microbial lifecycle. We highlight ways that amendments, crop rotations, and tillage practices might affect microbial CUE conditions and the variable outcomes of these practices. We argue that to resolve some of the unknowns of CUE dynamics, we need to include more mechanistic, trait-based approaches that capitalize on advanced methods and innovative field research designs within an agroecosystem-specific context. By identifying the management-level determinants of CUE expression, we will be better positioned to optimize CUE to increase soil C storage in agricultural systems.},

A common body of knowledge is required in order to understand and assess this impact of agriculture, and take proper countermeasures with a focus on the sustainability and the protection of the physical environment, affecting agricultural productivity as little as possible. In this paper, we examine the problem of the environmental impact of livestock agriculture, targeting animal manure, which is a serious problem in various territories of Europe and the USA. Aiming to address this problem, we have developed AgriBigCAT, an online software platform that uses geophysical information from various diverse sources, employing geospatial and big data analysis, together with web technologies, in order to estimate the impact of the livestock agricultural sector on the environment, examining possible pollution of land, water and air, considering various scenarios and potential applications to mitigate the problem. The AgriBigCAT platform can assist both the farmers’ decision-making processes and the administration planning and policy making, with the ultimate objective of meeting the challenge of increasing food production at a lower environmental impact.},

  abstract = {Based on the Introductory Carbon Balance Model, ICBM, we present a set of analytically solved models. The original ICBM comprises ‘Young’ and ‘Old’ soil C, two decay constants and parameters for litter input,’humification’ and external influences — in all five parameters. The new models describe soil C (and N) balances more in detail, but they are built around the same core concepts such as first-order decomposition kinetics and a minimum number of soil C and N pools. More complex processes, such as plant growth and mortality as well as weather influence are not explicitly included. However, these processes are allowed to influence the model predictions by modifying model parameter values. These modifications may be based on ‘best guesses’, parameter optimisations to available data, or independent ‘front-end models’, e.g. calculations of temperature influence on decomposer activity. Listed according to increasing complexity, the models are: (1) ICBM/N, which is ICBM with nitrogen added. It calculates net N-mineralisation and adds parameters for C/N ratios and soil organisms as well as organism efficieny — nine parameters in all; (2) ICBM/2N, which gives a more precise description of the initial stages of decomposition by splitting the ‘Young’ pool into two. The nitrogen part of the model has parameters for the C/N ratios of ‘labile’ and ‘refractory’ input of organic material, organism biomass and humification and also microbial growth efficiency for ‘labile’ and ‘refractory’. The model has 13 parameters in all, but can be run as a pure C model (ICBM/2) with only seven parameters; (3) ICBM/2BN, where organism biomass C and N is explicitly modelled. This model is usually run with daily, weekly or monthly steps and adds parameters related to biomass — 18 parameters in total — and can be run as a pure C model (ICBM/2B) with 13 parameters or even as a model with only one ‘Young’ pool (ICBM/B). We give examples of model applications, both short- and long-term, and show that the models relatively easily can be applied to various, more or less incomplete, data sets. The models do not require simulation techniques and are easily programmed in, e.g. electronic spreadsheets such as Microsoft Excel. By transformation of the time steps even dynamic driving variables, e.g. weather-related, can be applied without simulation.

  abstract = {Land use in general and particularly agricultural practices can signi®cantly in¯uence soil carbon (C) storage. Changes in topsoil C mass measured in long-term agricultural ®eld trials in Sweden and other Northern European countries were compiled and aggregated into seven treatment classes, including manured, fertilized and straw exported. The impact of crop rotations and management practices on C stocks in the topsoil was analyzed using both a static model and a dynamic soil carbon model (introductory C Balance Model; ICBM). ICBM consists of two state variables and four ¯uxes (governed by four rate-determining parameters), and one parameter, re, combining most external factors affecting C mineralization (temperature, precipitation, drainage, etc.). Simple `front-end models' were used to estimate values for two of the parameters, i (annual C input) and h (humi®cation coef®cient) initially based on incomplete records from the ®eld trials, of®cial agricultural statistics and other literature. The re parameter was then optimized for each class of treatments, using an algorithm for non-linear least squares. Initial soil C mass, present C inputs and abiotic conditions, such as soil temperature and moisture, were the deciding factors in whether C stocks declined or increased. Steady-state values calculated using the static and dynamic model were similar for both models, but differed greatly between treatment classes. For cereal-dominated cropping systems where the straw was removed, manure application increased steady-state values about three times (from 3 to 9 g C mÀ2), compared with corresponding treatments. Incorporation of straw resulted in intermediate steady-state values (5±6 g C mÀ2). C mineralization rates were highest in bare fallow treatments. For one class of soils, C retention in the soil was found to increase signi®cantly with increasing clay content. The hypothesis that the climatic gradients in Northern Europe affect decomposition and primary production rates similarly, leading to the same soil C stocks, could not be rejected. \# 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

  abstract = {The application of dynamic models to report changes in soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks, for example as part of greenhouse gas inventories, is becoming increasingly important. Most of these models rely on input data from harvest residues or decaying plant parts and also organic fertilizer, together referred to as soil carbon inputs (C). The soil C inputs from plants are derived from measured agricultural yields using allometric equations. Here we compared the results of five previously published equations. Our goal was to test whether the choice of method is critical for modelling soil C and if so, which of these equations is most suitable for Swiss conditions. For this purpose we used the five equations to calculate soil C inputs based on yield data from a Swiss long-term cropping experiment. Estimated annual soil C inputs from various crops were averaged from 28 years and four fertilizer treatments; the average was 3.6 Mg C ha−1 and covered a surprisingly large range from 2.1 to 5.3 Mg C ha−1 year−1 among the five equations. For single crop species, differences reached 6.6 Mg C ha−1 year−1. The variation between estimated soil C inputs depended on crop type and increased with yield. Simulations with the model C-TOOL showed that calculated SOC stocks were affected strongly by the choice of the allometric equation. With four equations, a decrease in SOC stocks was simulated, whereas with one equation there was no change. This considerable uncertainty in modelled soil C is attributable solely to the allometric equation used to estimate the soil C input. We identify the evaluation and selection of allometric equations and associated coefficients as critical steps when setting up a model-based soil C inventory for agricultural systems.},

We found that Century successfully simulates SOM C across a variety of land use and climate types. Simulations of SOM were most successful in grass and crop systems. This exercise highlights a structural limitation of Century in simulating SOM in a forest with a developed litter layer. Simulations of tree biomass distributions, however, were generally successful. The model failed to capture extreme values of yield and N offtake, although annual averages were quite similar between observations and simulations, leading to reasonable estimates of SOM C. Average yields and SOM were generally higher in amended treatments or rotations including an N-fixing component such as alfalfa. The model successfully predicted SOM dynamics across climates, land use types, and treatments. This suggests that Century is a useful tool for ecosystem studies, particularly those focused on SOM dynamics. © 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.},

  abstract = {Confined animal feeding operations (CAFOs) contribute to greenhouse gas emission, but the magnitude of these emissions as a function of operation size, infrastructure, and manure management are difficult to assess. Modeling is a viable option to estimate gaseous emission and nutrient flows from CAFOs. These models use a decomposition rate constant for carbon mineralization. However, this constant is usually determined assuming a homogenous mix of manure, ignoring the effects of emerging manure treatments. The aim of this study was to measure and compare the decomposition rate constants of dairy manure in single and three-pool decomposition models, and to develop an empirical model based on chemical composition of manure for prediction of a decomposition rate constant. Decomposition rate constants of manure before and after an anaerobic digester (AD), following coarse fiber separation, and fine solids removal were determined under anaerobic conditions for single and three-pool decomposition models. The decomposition rates of treated manure effluents differed significantly from untreated manure for both single and three-pool decomposition models. In the single-pool decomposition model, AD effluent containing only suspended solids had a relatively high decomposition rate of 0.060 dÀ1, while liquid with coarse fiber and fine solids removed had the lowest rate of 0.013 dÀ1. In the three-pool decomposition model, fast and slow decomposition rate constants (0.25 dÀ1 and 0.016 dÀ1 respectively) of untreated AD influent were also significantly different from treated manure fractions. A regression model to predict the decomposition rate of treated dairy manure fitted well (R2 ¼ 0.83) to observed data.},

  abstract = {Soils are the most complex and diverse ecosystem in the world. In addition to providing humanity with 98.8\% of its food, soils provide a broad range of other services, from carbon storage and greenhouse gas regulation, to flood mitigation and providing support for our sprawling cities. But soil is a finite resource, and rapid human population growth coupled with increasing consumption is placing unprecedented pressure on soils through the intensification of agricultural production – the increasing of crop yield per unit area of soil. Indeed, the human population has increased from ca. 250 million in the year 1000, to 6.1 billion in the year 2000, and is projected to reach 9.8 billion by the year 2050. The current intensification of agricultural practices is already resulting in the unsustainable degradation of soils. Major forms of this degradation include the loss of organic matter and the release of greenhouse gases, the over-application of fertilizers, erosion, contamination, acidification, salinization, and loss of genetic diversity. This ongoing soil degradation is decreasing the long-term ability of soils to provide humans with services, including future food production, and is causing environmental harm. It is imperative that the global society is not shortsighted by focusing solely on the near-immediate benefits of soils, such as food supply. A failure to identify the importance of soil within increasingly intensive agricultural systems will undoubtedly have serious consequences for humanity and represents a failure to consider intergenerational equity. Of utmost importance is the need to unequivocally recognize that the degradation of soils leads to a clear economic cost through the loss of services, with such principles needing to be explicitly considered in economic frameworks and decision-making processes at all levels of governance. We contend that the concept of the Water-Food-Energy nexus must be expanded, forming the Water-Soil-Food-Energy nexus.},

  abstract = {The shelterbelt component of Canada’s whole-farm model Holos was upgraded from an age-determined to a circumference-determined (at breast height) calculation using a multi-stem averaging approach. The model interface was developed around the idea that a shelterbelt could have multiple rows, and a variable species composition within each row. With this, the model calculates the accumulated aboveground carbon in the standing biomass and a lookup table of modeled tree growth is used to add estimates of the belowground carbon. Going from an initial interface that asks for the current state, the model also incorporates an option of past and future shelterbelt plantings. In order to test the model’s suitability, we measured diverse shelterbelts (evergreen, deciduous, shrub type) in southern Saskatchewan, Canada representing commonly planted woody species. By making use of Caragana, Green Ash, Colorado Spruce, Siberian Elm, and a mixed Caragana/Green Ash tree row, we tested how many tree circumference measurements would be required to yield a representative average. Later, these results were incorporated in the Holos model to estimate the accumulated aboveand below-ground carbon in each shelterbelt type.},

Development and evaluation of a new Canadian spring wheat sub-model for DNDC. Can. J. Soil Sci. 91: 503Á520. In this paper, the ability of the DNDC model (version 93) to predict biomass production, grain yield and plant nitrogen content was assessed using data from experiments at Swift Current, Saskatchewan, and St-Blaise, Quebec, Canada. While predicting wheat grain yields reasonably well, the model overestimated the growth of above-ground plant biomass and nitrogen uptake during the first half of the growing season. A new spring wheat sub-model (DNDC-CSW) was introduced with a modified plant biomass growth curve, dynamic plant C/N ratios and modified plant biomass fractioning curves. DNDC-CSW performed considerably better in simulating plant biomass [modeling efficiency (EF): 0.75, average relative error (ARE): 6.0\%] and plant nitrogen content (EF: 0.61, ARE: (2.7\%) at Swift Current and StBlaise (EF of 0.75 and ARE of 2.3\%), compared with DNDC 93 (biomass SC: EF 0.49, ARE 17.1\%, SB: EF 0.02 ARE 33.4\%). In comparison with DNDC 93, DNDC-CSW better captured inter-annual variations in crop growth for a range of wheat rotations, increasing the EF from 0.32 to 0.52 for grain and from 0.35 to 0.39 for straw yields. DNDC-CSW also performed considerably better than DNDC 93 in estimating soil carbon changes at Swift Current. Hence, DNDC-CSW has the potential to improve the performance of DNDC 93 in simulating wheat biomass, plant nitrogen, yield and soil carbon at various Canadian sites.},

  abstract = {Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions remain an important field of agricultural research. Apart from measuring, simulations are frequently used to investigate management impacts on GHG emissions. The HOLOS model has been developed (using country specific emission factors) to explore potential mitigation practices with respect to GHG emission reduction or increased carbon storage. However, avoided GHG emissions can create nutrient surpluses, and thus other environmental hazards (e.g. for human and/or ecosystem health). We propose to expand the ‘‘Virtual Farm’’ concept by connecting the budgets carbon, nitrogen, and energy flows, and thus estimate environmental impacts as a function of management choices, environment, and climate influence. Initial tests to combine HOLOS with the carbon model Introductory Carbon Balance Model (ICBM) in Norway have been promising. The approach will be further developed for Canadian farming systems, based on a minimum of required input data, but with the option of using specific inputs if the data are available.},

These factors are discussed within the framework of current soil organic matter models. The importance of soil structure in the stabilisation of organic residues through physical protection has been documented previously in various studies. In addition, changes in soil structure associated with tillage can significantly affect soil organic matter decomposition rates. The concept of physical protection has been incorporated into several soil carbon models as a function of soil texture. While soil texture can affect the soil's capacity for aggregation and adsorption, factors such as soil moisture and temperature may further enhance or reduce the extent of physical protection. While adsorption and aggregation can slow decomposition processes, it is unlikely that these processes are solely responsible for the high mean residence times measured in biologically active surface soils. Accordingly, chemical recalcitrance appears to be the only mechanism by which soil organic carbon can be protected for long periods of time.},

  abstract = {The scientific community, forest managers, environmental organizations, carbon-offset trading systems and policy-makers require tools to account for forest carbon stocks and carbon stock changes. In this paper we describe updates to the Carbon Budget Model of the Canadian Forest Sector (CBM-CFS3) implemented over the past years. This model of carbon-dynamics implements a Tier 3 approach of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Good Practice Guidance for reporting on carbon stocks and carbon stock changes resulting from Land Use, Land-use Change and Forestry (LULUCF). The CBMCFS3 is a generic modelling framework that can be applied at the stand, landscape and national levels. The model provides a spatially referenced, hierarchical system for integrating datasets originating from different forest inventory and monitoring programs and includes a structure that allows for tracking of land areas by different land-use and landuse change classes. Ecosystem pools in CBM-CFS3 can be easily mapped to IPCC-defined pools and validated against field measurements. The model uses sophisticated algorithms for converting volume to biomass and explicitly simulates individual annual disturbance events (natural and anthropogenic). Several important scientific updates have been made to improve the representation of ecosystem structure and processes from previous versions of CBM-CFS. These include: (1) an expanded representation of dead organic matter and soil carbon, particularly standing dead trees, and a new algorithm for initializing these pools prior to simulation, (2) a change in the input data requirement for simulating growth from biomass to readily available merchantable volume curves, and new algorithms for converting volume to biomass, (3) improved prediction of belowground biomass, and (4) improved parameters for soil organic matter decay, fire, insect disturbances, and forest management. In addition, an operational-scale version of CBM-CFS3 is freely available and includes tools to import data in standard formats, including the output of several timber supply models that are commonly used in Canada. Although developed for Canadian forests, the flexible nature of the model has enabled it to be adapted for use in several other countries.},

We conducted this inverse modeling by using a surrogate model for CENTURY's soil organic C (SOC) dynamics submodel. The model entails the mass balance and decomposition kinetics equations for residue and SOM pools identical to those of CENTURY that are coded in the programming language of the SAS statistical software to use various statistical functions embedded within a nonlinear regression procedure of SAS. We used the surrogate CENTURY to objectively estimate site-specific masses of SOC in three (active, slow, and passive) pools from the soils.},

  abstract = {Globally, agricultural soils are being evaluated for their role in climate change regulation as a potential sink for atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) through sequestration of organic carbon as soil organic matter. Scientists and policy analysts increasingly seek to develop programs and policies which recognize the importance of mitigation of climate change and insurance of ecological sustainability when managing agricultural soils. In response, many countries are exploring options to develop local land-use carbon inventories to better understand the flow of carbon in agriculture to estimate its contribution to greenhouse gas (GHG) reporting. For instance, the Canadian province of Ontario does not currently have its own GHG inventory and relies on the Canada’s National Inventory Report (NIR). To address this, the province explored options to develop its own land-use carbon inventory to better understand the carbon resource in agricultural soils. As part of this undertaking, a gap analysis was conducted to identify the critical information gaps and limitations in estimating soil organic carbon (SOC) monitoring to develop a land-use carbon inventory (LUCI) for the cropland sector in Ontario. We conducted a review of analytical and modeling methods used to quantify GHG emissions and reporting for the cropland sectors in Canada, and compared them with the methods used in seven other countries (i.e., France, United Kingdom; Germany; United States of America, Australia, New Zealand, and Japan). From this comparison, four target areas of research were identified to consider in the development of a cropland sector LUCI in Ontario. First, there needs to be a refinement of the modelling approach used for SOC accounting. The Century model, which is used for Ontario’s cropland sector, can benefit from updates to the crop growth model and from the inclusion of manure management and other amendments. Secondly, a raster-based spatially explicit modelling approach is recommended as an alternative to using polygon-based inputs for soil data and census information for land management. This approach can leverage readily available Earth Observation (EO) data (e.g., remote sensing maps, digital soil maps). Thirdly, the contributions from soil erosion need to be included in inventory estimates of SOC emissions and removals from cropland. Fourth, establishment of an extensive network of long-term experimental sites to calibrate and validate the SOC models (i.e., CENTURY) is required. This can be done by putting in place a ground-truth program, through farmer-led research initiatives and collaboration, to deal with uncertainties due to spatial variability and regional climates. This approach would provide opportunities for farmers to collaborate on data collection by keeping detailed records of their cropping and soil management practices, and crop yields.},

Carbon sequestration implies transfer of atmospheric CO               2               into other long-lived global pools including oceanic, pedologic, biotic and geological strata to reduce the net rate of increase in atmospheric CO               2               .

These techniques have a large potential of thousands of Pg, are expensive, have leakage risks and may be available for routine use by 2025 and beyond. In comparison, biotic techniques are natural and cost-effective processes, have numerous ancillary benefits, are immediately applicable but have finite sink capacity. Biotic and abiotic C sequestration options have specific nitches, are complementary, and have potential to mitigate the climate change risks.},

  abstract = {An increase in atmospheric concentration of CO2 from 280 ppmv in 1750 to 367 ppmv in 1999 is attributed to emissions from fossil fuel combustion estimated at 270 + 30 Pg C and land use change at 136 + 55 Pg. Of the emissions from land use change, 78 + 12 Pg is estimated from depletion of soil organic carbon (SOC) pool. Most agricultural soils have lost 50 to 70\% of their original SOC pool, and the depletion is exacerbated by further soil degradation and desertification. The restoration of degraded soils, conversion of agriculturally marginal lands to appropriate land use, and the adoption of recommended management practices on agricultural soils can reverse degradative trends and lead to SOC sequestration. Technological options for SOC sequestration on agricultural soils include adoption of conservation tillage, use of manures, and compost as per integrated nutrient management and precision farming strategies, conversion of monoculture to complex diverse cropping systems, meadow-based rotations and winter cover crops, and establishing perennial vegetation on contours and steep slopes. The global potential of SOC sequestration and restoration of degraded/desertified soils is estimated at 0.6 to 1.2 Pg C/y for about 50 years with a cumulative sink capacity of 30 to 60 Pg. The SOC sequestration is a costeffective strategy of mitigating the climate change during the first 2 to 3 decades of the 21st century. While improving soil quality, biomass productivity and enhanced environment quality, the strategy of SOC sequestration also buys us time during which the non-carbon fuel alternatives can take effect.},

This study examined the influence of handling treatment (fresh, stockpiled, or composted) on nutrient levels and mass balance estimates of feedlot manure at Lethbridge, Alberta, and Brandon, Manitoba. Total carbon (TC) concentration of compost (161 kg Mg21) was lower (P , 0.001) than stockpiled (248 kg Mg21), which was in turn lower (P , 0.001) than fresh manure (314 kg Mg21). Total nitrogen (TN) concentration was not affected by handling treatment while total phosphorus (TP) concentration increased with composting at Lethbridge. The percent inorganic nitrogen (PIN) was lower (P , 0.01) for compost (5.1\%) than both fresh (24.7\%) and stockpiled (28.9\%) manure. Composting led to higher (P , 0.05) dry matter (DM) losses (39.8\%) compared to stockpiling (22.5\%) and higher (P , 0.05) total mass (water 1 DM) losses (65.6 vs. 35.2\%). Carbon (C) losses were higher (P , 0.01) with composting (66.9\% of initial) than with stockpiling (37.5\%), as were nitrogen (N) losses (46.3 vs. 22.5\%, P , 0.05). Composting allowed transport of two times as much P as fresh manure and 1.4 times as much P as stockpiled manure (P , 0.001) on an “as is” basis. Our study looked at one aspect of manure management (i.e., handling treatment effects on nutrient concentrations and mass balance estimates) and, as such, should be viewed as one component in the larger context of a life cycle assessment.},

Research on windrow composting of feedlot manure was initiated at the Lethbridge Research Centre of Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada in 1996. Early studies looked at physical and chemical changes during composting. Studies have also been conducted on greenhouse gas emissions during composting and the effect of composting on reduction of pathogens, parasites and weed seed viability. The quality of commercially-produced composts at southern Alberta feedlots has been examined as has the mineralization rates of soil-applied composts. This paper reviews results from our feedlot manure composting research program.},

  abstract = {An indicator to evaluate the proportion of exogenous organic matter (EOM) remaining in soils over the long-term after application has been developed. A database was constructed with analytical data corresponding to 83 EOMs, including sludges, composts, animal wastes, mulches, plant materials and fertilizers. The data included results of proximal analysis (soluble, SOL, hemicellulose-, HEM, cellulose-, CEL, and lignin-like, LIC, fractions, in g kgÀ1 total organic matter) and of carbon (C) mineralization during long-term incubations under laboratory conditions (in g kgÀ1 exogenous organic C, EOC). The potential residual organic C after EOM application to soil was assessed from the extrapolation of the incubation results. Then, partial least square regression was used to relate EOM characteristics to the proportion of potentially residual organic C previously determined from the incubations. The biochemical fractions of EOM were not predictive enough to develop the indicator. The proportion of organic C mineralized during 3 days of incubation (C3d) was cumulated and appeared to be the most predictive variable of residual organic C. The proposed indicator of residual organic carbon in soils (expressed as g EOC kgÀ1) was IROC ¼ 445 þ 0.5 SOL – 0.2 CEL þ 0.7 LIC – 2.3 C3d. The indicator was calculated for the main types of EOM applied to soils. When compared with the few field data of residual C measured in long-term field experiments, the values provided by the indicator seemed to be over-estimated (i.e. EOC degradation could be faster under field conditions than during laboratory incubations).},

In comparison to uncontaminated soil, the microbial biomass C decreased sharply in soil contaminated with Zn and T1, whereas the addition of Pb did not have any significant inhibitory effect on the level of microbial biomass C. Zn displayed the greatest biocidal effect, confirmed by the measurement of the death rate quotient (qD). The microbial activity, measured as CO 2 evolution, increased significantly in contaminated soils, emphasizing the need of living organisms to expend more energy to survive. The greater demand for energy by microorganisms in order to cope with the toxicity of pollutants was also confirmed by measurement of the metabolic quotient (qCO2). In order to determine whether soil microorganisms affect the bioavailability of these metals through their mobilization and release, we studied the relationships between available Pb, Zn, and T1, and microbial biomass C. The water-soluble fraction of T1, available T1, and Zn, and microbial biomass C were related significantly, but not Pb.},

Eight field studies using various types and rates of manure applications on different crop rotations with durations varying from 10 to 74 years were used to quantify MCRs across diverse climatic conditions in Canada. The rate of solid cattle and swine manure had no impact on MCR which averaged 26\%, whereas the MCR for liquid manure, including swine and cattle liquid manures, was much smaller, at only 5\%. Under semi-arid conditions, irrigation had no impact on MCR. Compared to stockpiled manures, composted manure had a higher MCR (\textasciitilde 36\%), due to the additional stabili­ zation of C during the composting process. The MCRs can be effectively stratified based on the type of manure affecting soil organic C differently, and the approach has potential application in regional and national estimates of soil C storage in Canada and elsewhere.},

  abstract = {While it is recognized that the accumulation and turnover of soil organic carbon (SOC) is driven by plant inputs and their subsequent microbial-mediated transformations, the roles of plant residue chemistry and microbial processes in controlling SOC dynamics under different fertilizer application regimes have not been well explored. In the present study, amino sugars and lignin phenols were used as biomarkers to investigate the changes in microbial necromass and plant-derived components in a 30-year cultivated Mollisol (0–20 cm) in response to different fertilizer application treatments, including synthetic fertilizers (NPK, 165 kg N ha− 1, 82.5 kg P2O5 ha− 1, and 82.5 kg K2O ha− 1 per year), pig manure at two application rates of 30 and 60 t ha− 1 per year, and com­ binations of manure and synthetic fertilizers (30 or 60 t ha− 1 manure per year plus 165 kg N ha− 1, 82.5 kg P2O5 ha− 1, and 82.5 kg K2O ha− 1 per year). Compared with the unfertilized plot (Control), 30-year application of synthetic fertilizers increased microbial biomass (161\%) and amino sugar production (19.7\%), but did not alter lignin phenol and SOC concentrations despite the increased plant input. Comparatively, long term manure ap­ plications increased the concentration of SOC (30.8–70.9\%), as well as that of amino sugars (82.9–107\%) and lignin (96.8–212\%) in soil. Nevertheless, despite the enhanced microbial biomass from low to high manure application rate, the proportion of amino sugars in the SOC decreased, reflecting a diluted contribution of mi­ crobial necromass in SOC pool buildup at high-rate manure application. On the contrary, the proportions of lignin phenols in the SOC in the manure treatments, as well as the ratios of lignin phenols and amino sugars (0.26–0.42), were larger than that in the NPK treatment (0.22) and increased with increasing manure application rate. Therefore, the manipulation of synthetic or organic fertilizer on SOC dynamics is associated with differ­ ential accumulation of microbial necromass and plant lignin in agro-ecosystems. The manure amendment enhanced the contribution of plant-derived components more than microbial necromass to long term SOC accumulation.},

We aim to determine the effects of inorganic and organic fertilizers on soil labile carbon (C) pools, microbial community structure and C mineralization rate under an intensive wheat-maize double cropping system in Northern China. Soil samples in 0–10 cm layer were collected from a nine-year field trial involved four treatments: no fertilizer, CK; nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) fertilizers, NP; maize straw combined with NP fertilizers, NPS; and manure plus straw and NP fertilizers, NPSM. Soil samples were analyzed to determine labile C pools (including dissolved organic C, DOC; light free organic C, LFOC; and microbial biomass C, MBC), microbial community composition (using phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) profiles) and SOC mineralization rate (from a 124-day incubation experiment). This study demonstrated that the application of chemical fertilizers (NP) alone did not alter labile C fractions, soil microbial communities and SOC mineralization rate from those observed in the CK treatment. Whereas the use of straw in conjunction with chemical fertilizers (NPS) became an additional labile substrate supply that decreased C limitation, stimulated growth of all PLFA-related microbial communities, and resulted in 53\% higher cumulative mineralization of C compared to that of CK. The SOC and its labile fractions explained 78.7\% of the variance of microbial community structure. Further addition of manure on the top of straw in the NPSM treatment did not significantly increase microbial community abundances, but it did alter microbial community structure by increasing G+/G- ratio compared to that of NPS. The cumulative mineralization of C was 85\% higher under NPSM fertilization compared to that of CK. Particularly, the NPSM treatment increased the mineralization rate of the resistant pool. This has to be carefully taken into account when setting realistic and effective goals for long-term soil C stabilization.},

  abstract = {Straw return has been widely recommended as an environmentally friendly practice to manage carbon (C) sequestration in agricultural ecosystems. However, the overall trend and magnitude of changes in soil C in response to straw return remain uncertain. In this meta-analysis, we calculated the response ratios of soil organic C (SOC) concentrations, greenhouse gases (GHGs) emission, nutrient contents and other important soil properties to straw addition in 176 published field studies. Our results indicated that straw return significantly increased SOC concentration by 12.8 Æ 0.4\% on average, with a 27.4 Æ 1.4\% to 56.6 Æ 1.8\% increase in soil active C fraction. CO2 emission increased in both upland (27.8 Æ 2.0\%) and paddy systems (51.0 Æ 2.0\%), while CH4 emission increased by 110.7 Æ 1.2\% only in rice paddies. N2O emission has declined by 15.2 Æ 1.1\% in paddy soils but increased by 8.3 Æ 2.5\% in upland soils. Responses of macro-aggregates and crop yield to straw return showed positively linear with increasing SOC concentration. Straw-C input rate and clay content significantly affected the response of SOC. A significant positive relationship was found between annual SOC sequestered and duration, suggesting that soil C saturation would occur after 12 years under straw return. Overall, straw return was an effective means to improve SOC accumulation, soil quality, and crop yield. Straw return-induced improvement of soil nutrient availability may favor crop growth, which can in turn increase ecosystem C input. Meanwhile, the analysis on net global warming potential (GWP) balance suggested that straw return increased C sink in upland soils but increased C source in paddy soils due to enhanced CH4 emission. Our meta-analysis suggested that future agro-ecosystem models and cropland management should differentiate the effects of straw return on ecosystem C budget in upland and paddy soils.},

  abstract = {An understanding of the dynamics of soil organic carbon (SOC) as affected by farming practices is imperative for maintaining soil productivity and mitigating global warming. The objectives of this study were to investigate the effects of long-term fertilization on SOC and SOC fractions for the whole soil profile (0–100 cm) in northwest China. The study was initiated in 1979 in Gansu, China and included six treatments: unfertilized control (CK), nitrogen fertilizer (N), nitrogen and phosphorus (P) fertilizers (NP), straw plus N and P fertilizers (NP+S), farmyard manure (FYM), and farmyard manure plus N and P fertilizers (NP+FYM). Results showed that SOC concentration in the 0–20 cm soil layer increased with time except in the CK and N treatments. Long-term fertilization significantly influenced SOC concentrations and storage to 60 cm depth. Below 60 cm, SOC concentrations and storages were statistically not significant between all treatments. The concentration of SOC at different depths in 0–60 cm soil profile was higher under NP+FYM follow by under NP+S, compared to under CK. The SOC storage in 0–60 cm in NP+FYM, NP+S, FYM and NP treatments were increased by 41.3\%, 32.9\%, 28.1\% and 17.9\%, respectively, as compared to the CK treatment. Organic manure plus inorganic fertilizer application also increased labile soil organic carbon pools in 0–60 cm depth. The average concentration of particulate organic carbon (POC), dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and microbial biomass carbon (MBC) in organic manure plus inorganic fertilizer treatments (NP+S and NP+FYM) in 0–60 cm depth were increased by 64.9–91.9\%, 42.5–56.9\%, and 74.7–99.4\%, respectively, over the CK treatment. The POC, MBC and DOC concentrations increased linearly with increasing SOC content. These results indicate that long-term additions of organic manure have the most beneficial effects in building carbon pools among the investigated types of fertilization.},

This study focused on the restoration potentials of tea-growing soils using organic materials available in tea ecosystems. The Selangor-Briah soil series association (Typic Endoaquepts) consisted of a high- (soil A) and a low-carbon (soil B) soils were incubated with different organic materials and released carbon dioxide (CO2) measured. Two kinetic models were applied to depict the mineralization process. Soil health parameters including microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen, dehydrogenase and catalase activities were determined to assess the restoration potentials. The parallel first-order kinetic model fitted well for all amendments. Gliricidia markedly enhanced the net cumulative CO2 flux in both soils. Charged biochar, tea waste and Gliricidia improved the microbial biomass carbon by 79–84\% in soil A and 82–93\% in soil B, respectively. Microbial quotients and biomass nitrogen were increased over 50 and 70\% in amended soils, respectively. Dehydrogenase activity was significantly accelerated over 80\% by compost, charged biochar and tea waste. Charged biochar remarkably increased the soil catalase activity by 141\%. Microbial biomass, dehydrogenase and catalase activities, and cumulative CO2 flux were positively correlated (r {$>$} 0.452) with one another. The studied amendments showed greater potential in improving the soil quality, while charged biochar, raw biochar and compost enrich the soil recalcitrant C pool ensuring the soil health in long term. Even though biochar sequesters carbon, it has to be charged with nutrients to achieve the soil restoration goals.},

  abstract = {The GrassGro model (a computer simulation of management-induced changes in range and pasture forage and livestock productivity) was combined with spreadsheet analyses to estimate the influence of improved grazing practices on soil organic carbon (SOC), and farm profitability, across native rangelands and tame pastures of the southern Canadian Prairies. Improved practices included complementary grazing (CG) and reduced stocking density (RSD) on rangeland; and N fertilization (FERT), seeded grass/legumes grazed continuously (GLGC) or rotationally (GLGR), and RSD on tame pastures. The analysis was stratified into three ecoregions on the basis of similarities in climate and soil type. Averaged over 30 yr and ecoregions, SOC rates of gain through improved management were 5 (RSD) to 26 (CG) kg C ha               -1               yr               -1               for rangelands, and 86 (RSD), 75 (GLGC), 62 (GLGR) and 222 (FERT) kg C ha               -1               yr               -1               for tame pastures.

The CG system alone improved net returns to the producer. The estimated potential combined SOC gain on prairie grazinglands (11.5 Mha) was 1.63 MMT CO               2               yr               -1               (or 0.465 MMT C yr               -1               ), slightly less than the 1.70 MMT CO               2               yr               -1               currently emitted from agricultural soils in Canada.

A mixed forage (timothy-red clover (Trifolium pratense L.) and monocrop timothy (Phleum pratense L.) sward were fertilized annually with ammonium nitrate (AN) at up to 150kg and 300 N ha-1 yr-1, respectively, from 19982001. Organic amendments, applied at up to 600 kg N ha-1 yr-1 in the first two years only, included composts derived from crop residue (CSC), dairy manure (DMC) or sewage sludge (SSLC), plus liquid dairy manure (DM), and supplied C to soil at 4.6 and 9.2 (CSC), 10.9 (SSLC), 10.0 (DMC) 2.9 (DM) Mg C ha-1. Soil samples (0-5cm; 510cm;10-15cm) were recovered in 2000 and 2001. Improvements in soil physical properties (soil bulk density and water content) were obtained for compost treatments alone. Composts alone influenced soil C:N ratio and substantially increased SOC concentration and mass (+ 5.2 to + 9.7 Mg C ha-1). Gains in soil organic carbon (SOC) with AN of 2.7 Mg C ha-1 were detectable by the third crop production year (2001). The lower C inputs, and more labile C, supplied by manure (DM) was reflected in reduced SOC gains (+ 2.5 Mg C ha-1) compared to composts. The distribution of C in densiometric (light fraction, LF; {$>$}1.7 g cm-3) and particulate organic matter (POM; litter ({$>$}2000µm); coarse-sand (250-2000µm); fine-sand (53-250µm) fractions varied with compost and combining fractionation by size and density improved interpretation of compost dynamics in soil. Combined POM accounted for 82.6\% of SOC gains with composts. Estimated compost turnover rates (k) ranged from 0.06 (CSC) to 0.09 yr-1 (DMC). Composts alone increased soil microbial biomass carbon (SMB-C) concentration (µg C g-1 soil). Soil available C (Cext) decreased significantly as compost maturity increased. For some composts (CSC), timothy yields matched those obtained with AN, and SOC gains were derived from both applied-C and increased crop residueC returns to soil. A trend towards improved C returns across all treatments was apparent for the mixed crop. Matching composts of varying quality with the appropriate (legume/non-legume) target crop will be critical to promoting soil C gains from compost use.},

  abstract = {The development of resilient cropping systems with high yield stability is becoming increasingly important due to future climatic and agronomic challenges. Consequently, it is essential to compare the effects of different agronomic management practices, such as cropping sequences and nutrient supply, on the stability of crop yields. Long-term experiments are a valuable resource for investigating these effects, as they provide enough time to accurately estimate stability parameters. The objective of the current study was to compare the effects of different cropping sequencing (\#1: continuous v. rotational), fertilization (\#2: mineral v. organic) and straw management techniques (in the case of continuous wheat; \#3: removal v. incorporation) on the yield stability of winter wheat; yield risk (the probability of yield falling below a threshold yield level) and inter-annual yield variability were used as stability indicators of the effects. Long-term yield data from the Broadbalk Wheat Experiment (Rothamsted, UK) were analysed using a mixed model. Overall, the results showed that rotational cropping combined with sufficient mineral N fertilizer, with or without organic manure, ensured stable wheat yields while reducing yield risk. In contrast, higher yield risks and inter-annual yield variabilities were found in continuous wheat sections with less mineral N fertilizer or with organic manure only.},

Soil Sci. 83: 483–495. Relying less on fertilizer N and more on crop residual and biological N2 fixation by legume crops has been suggested as an effective way to meet the challenge of maximizing economic return while minimizing environmental pollution. A field study was conducted on a Brandon loam soil (Orthic Humic Gleysol) to determine the effects of crop rotation and N amendments on grain yield, crop growth, N uptake and use efficiency (NUE) of maize (Zea mays L.) and fertilizer replacement values of legume. The rotations included maize in annual rotation with soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merrill], at 100 kg N ha–1, alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) or continuous maize. The soil N stockpiled or rotted dairy manure at 50 Mg ha–1 (wet weight). amendments included no amendment, NH4NO3 Averaged across 4 yr, increases in maize grain yield, total plant N uptake, and NUE ranged from 13 to 35\% in the maize-soybean and maize-alfalfa rotations compared to continuous maize monoculture. During the study, total dry matter production was 15 to 35\% higher and crop growth rate was 13 to 23\% higher for maize following alfalfa than for continuous maize monoculture. The effect of legumes on the subsequent growth of maize (i.e., total dry matter production and crop growth rate) was most apparent during the grain filling period. Total maize dry matter production was similar up to silking stage for all three rotation systems; however, the difference in total dry matter between maize monoculture and maize in rotation with legume continued to increase after this stage so that the greatest differences were observed at physiological maturity. Grain yield was 19\% higher in the 100 kg N ha–1 treatment and 23\% higher in the repeated manure amendment than in the unfertilized treatment. Fertilizer N replacement values were on average, 68 kg ha–1 for soybean and 133 kg ha–1 for alfalfa. Our results indicate that maize in annual rotation with legume crops could increase the maize yields by as much as 20\% and reduce the amount of chemical fertilizer N by as much as 180 kg N ha–1. The effect of legume preceding crop on maize dry matter production and N uptake is expressed mostly in the later stages of crop growth in this mid- to short-growing-season region.},

  abstract = {Land application of farmyard manure (FYM) is a widespread agronomic practice used to enhance soil fertility, but its long-term effects on soil microbial carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling have not been investigated in detail. Topsoils (0–23 cm) and subsoils (23–38 cm) were collected from a field trial on a sandy-textured soil where FYM had been applied at high (50–25 t haÀ 1 yrÀ 1, 28 yr) and low rates (10 t haÀ 1 yrÀ 1, 16 yr), and compared to soil treated only with synthetic NPK fertilisers. The turnover rate of key components of soil organic matter (SOM; proteins, peptides, amino acids, cellulose, and glucose) were evaluated by 14C labelling and measuring cellobiohydrolase, β-glucosidase, β-1,4-N-acetylglucosaminidase, L-leucine aminopeptidase, protease, and deaminase activities, whereas gross NH4þ and NO3À production and consumption were determined by 15Nisotope pool dilution. Microbial communities were determined using phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) profiling. Our results indicate that long-term FYM addition significantly enhanced the accumulation of soil C and N, soil organic N (SON) turnover, exoenzyme activity, and gross NO3À production and assimilation. Rates of protein, peptide, and amino acid processing rate were 169–248, 87–147, and 85–305 mg N kgDÀ W1 soil dÀ 1, respectively, gross NH4þ and NO3À production and consumption were 1.8–5.8 mg N kgDÀ W1 soil dÀ 1, and the highest rates were shown under the high FYM treatment in topsoil and subsoil. The half-life of cellulose and glucose decomposition under the high FYM treatment were 16.4\% and 31.0\% lower than them in the synthetic NPK fertiliser treatment, respectively, indicating higher rates of C cycling under high manure application as also evidenced by the higher rate of CO2 production. This was ascribed to an increase in microbial biomass rather than a change in microbial community structure. Based on the high pool sizes and high turnover rate, this suggests that peptides may represent one of the dominant forms of N taken up by soil microorganisms. We conclude that long-term FYM application builds SOM reserves and induces faster rates of nutrient cycling by boosting microbial biomass rather than by changing its community composition.},

  abstract = {The impact of animal manure application on soil organic carbon (SOC) stock changes is of interest for both agronomic and environmental purposes. There is a specific need to quantify SOC change for use in national greenhouse gas (GHG) emission inventories. We quantified the response of SOC stocks to manure application from a large worldwide pool of individual studies and determined the impact of explanatory factors such as climate, soil properties, land use and manure characteristics. Our study is based on a meta-analysis of 42 research articles totaling 49 sites and 130 observations in the world. A dominant effect of cumulative manure-C input on SOC response was observed as this factor explained at least 53\% of the variability in SOC stock differences compared to mineral fertilized or unfertilized reference treatments. However, the effects of other determining factors were not evident from our data set. From the linear regression relating cumulative C inputs and SOC stock difference, a global manure-C retention coefficient of 12\% Æ 4 (95\% Confidence Interval, CI) could be estimated for an average study duration of 18 years. Following an approach comparable to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, we estimated a relative SOC change factor of 1.26 Æ 0.14 (95\% CI) which was also related to cumulative manure-C input. Our results offer some scope for the refinement of manure retention coefficients used in crop management guidelines and for the improvement of SOC change factors for national GHG inventories by taking into account manure-C input. Finally, this study emphasizes the need to further document the long-term impact of manure characteristics such as animal species, especially pig and poultry, and manure management systems, in particular liquid vs. solid storage.},

  abstract = {Quantifying and understanding the impact of animal manure on soil organic carbon (OC) is important for agronomic and environmental purposes. The influence of liquid manure on soil OC stocks has been less studied and was found to be more variable than that of solid manure. In addition, only a few studies have analyzed the effects of animal manure on stable fractions of soil OC. Our objective was to quantify OC in the whole soil and in specific physical fractions of organic matter (free and intra-aggregate light fractions, and sand and silt + clay-size heavy fractions) within a 0–50 cm soil profile after 17 years of applications of liquid dairy manure (LDM) and mineral fertilizer on a perennial grass sward. The mineral fertilizer and LDM were applied at nominally 200 and 400 kg mineral-N haÀ1 yearÀ1 (low and high rates, respectively) to tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb. var. Festorina), grown on a Monroe silt in a maritime climate near Agassiz, British Columbia, Canada. The LDM applications provided an average of 3.8 and 7.3 Mg C haÀ1 yearÀ1 for the low and high rates, respectively. The whole-soil OC stock was significantly higher in the top 20 cm of soils amended with LDM than either soils with mineral fertilizer or unamended soils. There were no differences in OC below 20 cm, which may be linked to the absence of C transfer at depth, or to an insufficient C input to offset a possible LDM-induced priming effect on soil OC mineralization. Compared to the unamended soil, mineral fertilization led to higher OC stocks in only the top 5 cm of soil. The application of LDM favored the incorporation of C into organo-mineral complexes rather than into the free light fraction of soil organic matter. The size separation of the heavy (density {$>$} 1.8 g mLÀ1) soil fraction revealed the presence of sand-size organo-mineral complexes that were responsive to treatments, and particularly to LDM application. This sand-size heavy fraction could be given greater scrutiny to detect more finely the effect of management changes on soil OC stocks.},

  abstract = {In the last 80 years, a number of mathematical models of different level of complexity have been developed to describe biogeochemical processes in soils, spanning spatial scales from few mm to thousands of km and temporal scales from hours to centuries. Most of these models are based on kinetic and stoichiometric laws that constrain elemental cycling within the soil and the nutrient and carbon exchange with vegetation and the atmosphere. While biogeochemical model performance has been previously assessed in other reviews, less attention has been devoted to the mathematical features of the models, and how these are related to spatial and temporal scales. In this review, we consider w250 biogeochemical models, highlighting similarities in their theoretical frameworks and illustrating how their mathematical structure and formulation are related to the spatial and temporal scales of the model applications. Our analysis shows that similar kinetic and stoichiometric laws, formulated to mechanistically represent the complex underlying biochemical constraints, are common to most models, providing a basis for their classification. Moreover, a historic analysis reveals that the complexity and degree and number of nonlinearities generally increased with date, while they decreased with increasing spatial and temporal scale of interest. We also found that mathematical formulations specifically developed for certain scales (e.g., first order decay rates assumed in yearly time scale decomposition models) often tend to be used also at other spatial and temporal scales different from the original ones, possibly resulting in inconsistencies between theoretical formulations and model application. It is thus critical that future modeling efforts carefully account for the scale-dependence of their mathematical formulations, especially when applied to a wide range of scales.},

In this laboratory study fresh leaf litter from two tree species (Melia azedarach, Castanea sativa ) and sugarcane (Saccharum ocinarum ) trash containing ash alkalinities of 288, 141 and 33 mmolc kgÀ1 respectively, were mixed at three dierent rates (4, 16, 32 mg gÀ1) with acidic topsoil from a Ultic Palexeralf and incubated at 90\% WHC and at 258C for 20 d while monitoring CO2-evolution. Treatment eects were assessed by measuring changes in pH, acid buering curves and exchangeable cations before and after incubation. Furthermore, soluble organic compounds, mineral N-forms were determined in soil extracts. Immediately after mixing, up to 50\% of the added alkalinity was available for acid neutralisation. After incubation, acid neutralisation capacity at pH 4 (ANCpH4) and the pH of the soils with the two higher amendment rates had increased in all treatments. The changes were most pronounced in the Melia amended soils, followed by Castanea and sugarcane and re¯ected the added amounts of ash alkalinity. In all treatments, soil respiration increased with amendment rate and was closely related to a decline in soluble organic carbon during incubation. Together with the shift from stronger to weaker acidity observed after incubation, this is evidence for the microbial decarboxylation of soluble organic anions. 7 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

  abstract = {Nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) is a measure of the extent to which a crop transforms available N to economic yield. Seasonal N mineralization of organic amendments increases available N and, depending on the timing of mineralization and crop requirements for N, may improve NUE while reducing soil N losses. A two-year study was conducted in an ongoing five-year field experiment (1992–1996) on a Brandon loam soil (fine-loamy, mixed, mesic Typic Endoaquoll) (Orthic Humic Gleysol) at the Central Experimental Farm, Ottawa, ON, Canada (45؇23؅ N, 75؇43؅ W). Our objectives were to (i) quantify the effects of inorganic N fertilizer, stockpiled (SM), and rotted manure (RM) application on seasonal N mineralization and (ii) monitor the mineral N balance in the soil–plant system. Application of manure at the highest rate having a mineral N (NH4ϩ plus NO3Ϫ) of ≈ 100 kg N haϪ1 and up to 800 kg N haϪ1 of total N resulted in up to 120 kg haϪ1 of net N mineralized. The potential loss of this mineralized N was minimized during the growing season compared with inorganic fertilizer application because of the synchronization of soil N release and uptake by maize (Zea mays L.). In soil receiving 200 kg inorganic N haϪ1, the amount of net N mineralized over the season was between 130 and 170 kg haϪ1, but large losses of mineral N from the rooting zone occurred during the same period. The amount of net N mineralized over the season accounted for up to half of the plant N uptake in all treatments; for example, the amount of net N mineralized in manured soils represented about 30 to 60\% of total plant N. It appears that a priming effect on soil mineral N occurred in all treatments during the vegetative period. This resulted in a curvilinear relationship between net N mineralization rate and soil mineral N levels at preplanting that reached a plateau at ≈ 140 kg N haϪ1. The rate of N mineralization during the grain-filling period was approximately the same at both levels of inorganic N fertilizer, but was, on average, three times higher under manure treatments. Compared with N mineralization under the 200 kg N haϪ1 fertilizer treatment, all manure treatments resulted in higher rates of net N mineralization during the grain-filling period.},

A 5-year field experiment was conducted on a Brandon loam soil (fine loamy, mixed, mesic Typic Endoaquoll) (Orthic Humic Gleysol) with the objective of measuring N uptake and grain yield of two maize hybrids under different N amendments [no amendment, NH4NO3 at 100 and 200 kg N haϪ1, and stockpiled and rotted dairy manure at 50 and 100 Mg haϪ1 (wet wt.)] to determine differences in N use efficiency (NUE) and its components, N uptake efficiency and N utilization efficiency. The N amendments increased the grain yield (by an average of 20\%) and NUE (by an average of 17.5\%) of a modern hybrid (Pioneer ‘3902’) more than that of an old hybrid (‘Pride 5’). The difference method that was used to estimate N recovery indicated that, over the course of the study, Pioneer 3902 took up 48\% of inorganic fertilizer N and 20\% of the manure N, compared with 42 and 16\%, respectively, for Pride 5. Manure application resulted in total N uptake comparable to the 200 kg N haϪ1 treatment. Grain yields of manure treatments in 1993 and 1994 were generally lower (5–15\%) than the 200 kg N haϪ1 treatment. During the latter periods (1995 and 1996) of the study with repeated application under continuous maize, all manure treatments produced grain yields equal to or slightly greater (6–13\%) than the fertilizer treatment. Dairy manure application increased N uptake and grain yield of maize. The NUE, based on added mineral N levels, for all manure treatments was greater than for the 200 kg N haϪ1 treatment.},

With elimination of both tillage and bare fallow, the SOC increase was approximately 300 kg C ha−1 per year in the semiarid climate regardless of soil texture, and approximately 800 kg C ha−1 per year in the sub-humid climate. Relative annual increase in SOC under no-till was approximately a linear function of clay content across locations.

All are process-oriented multicompartment models. Few attributes are needed to distinguish among them and with few exceptions they are empirical in nature. There appears to be a trend to include inert organic matter but not to specify its nature nor rate of formation. Soil texture is increasingly included in SOM models both to protect or slow decomposition of soil organic components, and to regulate partitioning of C among compartments. About half the models represent a homogeneous soil unit. Concepts pertaining to the nature of litter are different from those pertaining to SOM, as indicated by inclusion of biomass as a SOM component but not a litter component.. Many models in the past have specified biochemical fractions to follow C and N through litter and SOM components, but in no case were biochemical separations applied to litter or SOM.},

  abstract = {In this paper we consider the influences of initial litter quality, exogenous nutrient supply, temperature and oxygen tension on decay rates and nutrient immobilization potentials of plant litter materials decomposing in northern streams. We review a new method of estimating nitrogen and phosphorus immobilization potentials in decaying litter. And we discuss the mechanisms responsible for nitrogen immobilization. Initial litter quality is the dominant factor that influences decay rate. Materials rich in nitrogen and poor in lignin generally decay most rapidly. Addition of nitrogen and/or phosphorus to the water often result(s) in increased decay rate as does elevation of water temperature. While low oxygen tension retards the decay of lignin and related compounds, it is not clear that low oxygen tension slows the rate of decay of more labile compounds. Initial litter quality is also the dominant factor that influences nitrogen immobilization potential. Materials poor in both nitrogen and lignin generally have the highest immobilization potentials. Addition of nitrogen to the water increases the immobilization potential ofa litter material. Plant litter decomposing under anaerobic conditions immobilizes less nitrogen than the same litter decomposing under aerobic conditions. And, all other conditions being equal, temperature changes will influence nitrogen immobilization rate but not its maximum amount. The amount of nitrogen directly associated with microbial biomass makes up only a small fraction of the total nitrogen mass in decomposing litter. Microbes appear to be important agents in the nitrogen immobilization process on decaying litter. The microbes produce exoenzymes which in turn cause the degradation of large molecules such as polyphenolics and lignins. Some of these degradation products, such as the "reactive phenolics," recondense with nitrogen containing compounds. The degradation-recondensation cycle continues throughout litter decay, with the ultimate product being nitrogen-rich humic substances.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Models of soil organic carbon (SOC) storage and turnover can be useful tools to analyse the effects of soil and crop management practices and climate change on soil organic carbon stocks. The aggregated structure of soil is known to protect SOC from decomposition and, thus, influence the potential for long-term sequestration. In turn, the turnover and storage of SOC affects soil aggregation, physical and hydraulic properties and the productive capacity of soil. These two-way interactions have not yet been explicitly considered in modelling approaches. In this study, we present and describe a new model of the dynamic feedbacks between soil organic matter (SOM) storage and soil physical properties (porosity, pore size distribution, bulk density and layer thickness). A sensitivity analysis was first performed to understand the behaviour of the model. The identifiability of model parameters was then investigated by calibrating the model against a synthetic data set. This analysis revealed that it would not be possible to unequivocally estimate all of the model parameters from the kind of data usually available in field trials. Based on this information, the model was tested against measurements of bulk density, SOC concentration and limited data on soil water retention and soil surface elevation made during 63~years in a field trial located near Uppsala (Sweden) in three treatments with different organic matter (OM) inputs (bare fallow, animal and green manure). The model was able to accurately reproduce the changes in SOC, soil bulk density and surface elevation observed in the field as well as soil water retention curves measured at the end of the experimental period in 2019 in two of the treatments. Treatment-specific variations in SOC dynamics caused by differences in OM input quality could be simulated very well by modifying the value for the OM retention coefficient ε (0.37~for animal manure and 0.14 for green manure). The model approach presented here may prove useful for management purposes, for example, in an analysis of carbon sequestration or soil degradation under land use and climate change.},

  abstract = {Feedlots in southern Alberta apply composted (CM) or stockpiled (SM) manure with straw (ST) or wood-chip (WD) bedding to cropland, but few studies have examined the effect of manure type and bedding material on carbon composition of these feedlot amendments prior to land application using solid-state 13C NMR-DPMAS (nuclear magnetic resonance-direct polarization, magic angle spinning). The particulate organic matter fraction was extracted from four amendment treatments (CM-ST, CMWD, SM-ST, SM-WD) to avoid possible paramagnetic interference from considerable mineral soil in the manure from the unpaved feedlot. The hypothesis was that O-alkyl C of POM should be lower for more decomposed manure types (CM than SM) and bedding materials (ST than WD), and that alkyl C, aromatic C, carboxyl C, aromaticity, and alkyl:O-alkyl (A:O-A) ratio should be greater for the more decomposed amendments. The C composition of all feedlot amendments was dominated by aromatic C (8\%–14\%) and O-alkyl (7\%–14\%) C and had considerable less contribution from carboxyl (2\%–4\%) and alkyl C (1\%–3\%). The manure type hypothesis was supported for O-alkyl C (but not for the other three C groups), aromaticity, but not the A:O-A ratio. The bedding hypothesis was supported for O-alkyl C, aromaticity, and A:O-A ratio, but not for alkyl C, aromatic C, and carboxyl C. A decrease in O-alkyl C, increase in aromaticity, and increase in A:O-A ratio (bedding only) with more decomposed manure types or bedding materials suggested that these 13C NMR parameters may have potential to evaluate the maturity and stability of composted feedlot manures.},

  abstract = {More than 10\% of Australia's 49 M ha of grassland is considered degraded, prompting widespread interest in the management of these ecosystems to increase soil carbon (C) sequestration—­with an emphasis on long-­lived C storage. We know that management practices that increase plant biomass also increase C inputs to the soil, but we lack a quantitative understanding of the fate of soil C inputs into different soil organic carbon (SOC) fractions that have fundamentally different formation pathways and persistence in the soil. Our understanding of the factors that constrain SOC formation in these fractions is also limited, particularly within tropical climates. We used isotopically labelled residue (13C) to determine the fate of residue C inputs into short-­ lived particulate organic matter (POM) and more persistent mineral-­associated organic matter (MAOM) across a broad climatic gradient (ΔMAT 10°C) with varying soil properties. Climate was the primary driver of aboveground residue mass loss which corresponded to higher residue-­derived POM formation. In contrast, MAOM formation efficiency was constrained by soil properties. The differential controls on POM and MAOM formation highlight that a targeted approach to grassland restoration is required; we must identify priority regions for improved grazing management in soils that have a relatively high silt+clay content and cation exchange capacity, with a low C saturation in the silt+clay fraction to deliver long-­term SOC sequestration.},

Both long term fertilization and moisture regime significantly affected C and N mineralization in soil. Long term integrated application of chemical fertilizer and organic manure (NPK þ FYM, N þ FYM) in soil resulted in higher potentially mineralizable C (C0), potentially mineralizable N (N0), rates of mineralization (dCmin/dt and dNmin/dt), microbial and mineralization quotients as compared to either of them applied alone (N, NPK, and FYM). Higher values of C0, N0, and rates of mineralization were recorded under aerobic condition than that under submergence. The amount of N released per unit C mineralization was higher in aerobic system that may result in greater loss of N from the system. A judicious N application strategy through integration of both organic and inorganic sources is essential for improving current N supplying capacity of soil and maintaining soil organic C pool in aerobic system.},

NCSOIL computes short-term dynamics of carbon and nitrogen organics, ammonium, and nitrate which result from the processes of residue decomposition, mineralization, immobilization, nitrification, and denitrification. Both total and isotopic nitrogen are considered. NCSOIL is built on the concept of catenary sequence of heterogenous substrates. The active soil organic phase is divided in two pools which are dynamic, defined by their kinetic rate constants and their position in the model structure. Residues are defined in terms of their chemical or morphological nature. A double feedback loop in the carbon flow adjusts the rate of residue decomposition and the efficiency factor to the availability of inorganic nitrogen. NCSOIL was calibrated with, and its behavior contrasted against published and unpublished data from an experiment reported by Chichester et al. in Soil Science (see p. 455, vol.120):"Relative Mineralization Rates of Indigenous and Recently Incorporated 15-N labeled Nitrogen."

  abstract = {Soil amendment with exogenous organic matter (EOM) represents an effective option for sustainable management of organic residues and enhancement of soil organic C (SOC) content. Optimization of soil amendment is hampered by the high variability in EOM quality and pedoclimatic conditions. A possible solution to this problem could be represented by spatially explicit soil C modeling. The aim of this study was the evaluation at regional level of the long term C storage potential of EOM added to the soil under climate change by using a modified version of the RothC specifically developed for C simulation in amended soil. To achieve this goal a spatially explicit version of the modified RothC model was deployed to assess at a national scale the potential for C storage of agricultural soils amended with different EOMs. Long term model simulations of continuous amendment (100 years) indicated that EOMs greatly differ for their soil C sequestration potential (range 0.110–0.385 t C ha−1 y−1), mainly depending to their degree of stabilization. Spatial explicit modeling of amended soil, taking into account the different combinations of EOMs and application sites, indicated a high variability in the potential of SOC accumulation at the national level (range: 0.06–0.62 t C ha−1 y−1). EOM quality showed a larger impact on long term SOC accumulation than variability in pedoclimatic conditions. Model simulations predicted that the contribution of soil amendment in tackling greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is limited: soil C sequestration potential of compost applied to all Italian agricultural land corresponded to 5.3\% of the total annual GHG emissions in Italy. Large scale modeling enables areas with the largest potential for EOM accumulation to be identified, therefore suggesting ways for optimizing resources. The spatially explicit version of the modified RothC model improves the predictive power of SOC modeling at regional scale in amended soils, because it takes into account, besides variability in pedoclimatic conditions, the large differences in EOMs quality.},

  abstract = {Availability of methods to determine kinetically-defined soil carbon pools may assist in better understanding soil organic matter turnover in tropical soils and its relationship with soil mineral fractions and nutrient cycling. Our objective was to compare three methods of estimating soil C pools for the top mineral soil horizon of 13 tropical forest soils with a wide range of clay content and differing soil mineralogies. The methods were: (i) regression analysis of CO,-C release from a 341 day incubation of unamended soils; (ii) results of C analysis procedures including determinations of soluble C, microbial biomass C and light fraction C; and (iii) CENTURY model simulations of equilibrium values of soil C pools. Soil mineralogy did not have a significant effect on CO,-C release, expressed as a proportion of total organic C, during incubation. However, allophanic soils had significantly higher total organic C, soluble C and light fraction C than soils of smectitic, kaolinitic or oxidic mineralogies. Clay and sand contents significantly correlated with cumulative proportional CO\& release. The active C pool, as determined by the CENTURY equilibrium method and measurements of soluble plus microbial biomass C, were less than the active C pool estimated by the incubation-regression method. Measured light fraction C was smaller than estimates from the CENTURY equilibrium method and incubation-regression estimates. Total organic C, soluble plus microbial biomass C and light fraction C had the highest correlations with cumulative incubation CO,-C release. Of the CENTURY model C pool estimates, only the slow C pool estimate correlated with incubation CO,-C release. The use of C analyses as soil C pool estimates for model simulations of the long-term incubation resulted in an underestimation of actual incubation CO,-C release. This underestimate was caused by a smaller slow pool estimated by light fraction analysis. In addition, structural and metabolic C pools were not measured and they have a large short-term effect on CO,-C release. Use of CENTURY equilibrium estimates, including estimates of structural and metabolic C, resulted in simulated CO,-C release comparable to actual CO,-C release patterns. However, the use of the CENTURY equilibrium method may be limited by the difficulty of obtaining adequate soil, plant and climatic information to run model simulations and by the validity of CENTURY model assumptions for factors controlling soil C pools under tropical climatic conditions.},

  abstract = {C and N mineralisation kinetics obtained in laboratory incubations during decomposition of crop residues under non-limiting nitrogen conditions were simulated using a simple dynamic model. This model includes three compartments: the residues, microbial biomass and humified organic matter. Seven parameters are used to describe the C and N fluxes. The decomposed C is either mineralised as CO2 or assimilated by the soil microflora, microbial decay producing both C humification and secondary C mineralisation. The N dynamics are governed by the C rates and the C:N ratio of the compartments which remain constant in the absence of nitrogen limitation. The model was parameterised using apparent C and N mineralisation kinetics obtained for 27 different residues (organs of oilseed rape plants) that exhibited very wide variations in chemical composition and nitrogen content. Except for the C:N ratio of the residues and the soil organic matter, the other five parameters of the model were obtained by non-linear fitting and by minimising the differences between observed and simulated values of CO2 and mineral N. Three parameters, namely the decomposition rate constant of the residues, the biomass C:N ratio and humification rate, were strongly correlated with the residues C:N ratio. Hyperbolic relationships were established between these parameters and the residues C:N ratio. In contrast, the other two parameters, i.e. the decay rate of the microbial biomass and the assimilation yield of residue-C by the microbial biomass, were not correlated to the residues C:N ratio and were, therefore, fixed in the model. The model thus parameterised against the residue C:N ratio as a unique criterion, was then evaluated on a set of 48 residues. An independent validation was obtained by taking into account 21 residues which had not been used for the parameterisation. The kinetics of apparent C and N mineralisation were reasonably well simulated by the model. The model tended to over-estimate carbon mineralisation which could limit its use for C predictions, but the kinetics of N immobilisation or mineralisation due to decomposition of residues in soil were well predicted. The model indicated that the C:N ratio of decomposers increased with the residue C:N ratio. Higher humification was predicted for substrates with lower C:N ratios. This simple dynamic model effectively predicts N evolution during crop residue decomposition in soil.},

It can also cause environmental damage, such as nitrate leaching. Characterisation of EOM to predict the C and N dynamics of mineralisation when applied to cropped soils is essential to improve its use in agriculture. The measurement of C and N mineralisation through soil laboratory incubation of 18 types of EOM and EOM biochemical fractionation were used to parameterise the NCSOIL model to simulate the mineralisation kinetics of C and N. The soil type did not significantly interfere with EOM mineralisation and parameterisation, enabling extrapolation of the parameters for one soil to other soil types. Four groups of EOM were distinguished based on their C and N dynamics: (1) stable compost, (2) more reactive compost and stable manure, (3) manure and (4) very reactive EOM as sludge and litter that should be used as fertiliser. The use of easily accessible indicators, such as IROC (Lashermes et al., 2009) and the measured organic C:N ratio (CNEOM), was appropriate for parameterising groups 1 and 4. Regression relating the optimised resistant pool size and Van Soest fractions and CNEOM was found (R2 of 0.967) to improve the pool sizes for the remaining EOM. Further research is required to improve the parameterisation.},

We derived estimates of management impacts for a carbon accounting approach developed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, addressing the impact of long-term cultivation, setting-aside land from crop production, changing tillage management, and modifying C input to the soil by varying cropping practices. We found 126 articles that met our criteria and analyzed the data in linear mixed-effect models. In general, management impacts were sensitive to climate in the following order from largest to smallest changes in SOC: tropical moist{$>$}tropical dry{$>$}temperate moist{$>$}temperate dry. For example, long-term cultivation caused the greatest loss of SOC in tropical moist climates, with cultivated soils having 0.58 Æ 0.12, or 58\% of the amount found under native vegetation, followed by tropical dry climates with 0.69 Æ 0.13, temperate moist with 0.71 Æ 0.04, and temperate dry with 0.82 Æ 0.04. Similarly, converting from conventional tillage to no-till increased SOC storage over 20 years by a factor of 1.23 Æ 0.05 in tropical moist climates, which is a 23\% increase in SOC, while the corresponding change in tropical dry climates was 1.17 Æ 0.05, temperate moist was 1.16 Æ 0.02, and temperate dry was 1.10 Æ 0.03. These results demonstrate that agricultural management impacts on SOC storage will vary depending on climatic conditions that influence the plant and soil processes driving soil organic matter dynamics.},

Models are not completely accurate or precise estimators of C pools, however, due to insufficient knowledge and imperfect conceptualizations about ecosystem processes, leading to uncertainty in the results. It can be difficult to quantify the uncertainty using traditional error propagation techniques, such as Monte Carlo Analyses, because of the structural complexity of simulation models. Empirically based methods provide an alternative to the error propagation techniques, and our objective was to apply this alternative approach. Specifically, we developed a linear mixedeffect model to quantify both bias and variance in modeled soil C stocks that were estimated using the Century ecosystem simulation model.

  abstract = {Process-based model analyses are often used to estimate changes in soil organic carbon (SOC), particularly at regional to continental scales. However, uncertainties are rarely evaluated, and so it is difficult to determine how much confidence can be placed in the results. Our objective was to quantify uncertainties across multiple scales in a processbased model analysis, and provide 95\% confidence intervals for the estimates. Specifically, we used the Century ecosystem model to estimate changes in SOC stocks for US croplands during the 1990s, addressing uncertainties in model inputs, structure and scaling of results from point locations to regions and the entire country. Overall, SOC stocks increased in US croplands by 14.6 Tg C yrÀ1 from 1990 to 1995 and 17.5 Tg C yrÀ1 during 1995 to 2000, and uncertainties were Æ 22\% and Æ 16\% for the two time periods, respectively. Uncertainties were inversely related to spatial scale, with median uncertainties at the regional scale estimated at Æ 118\% and Æ 114\% during the early and latter part of 1990s, and even higher at the site scale with estimates at Æ 739\% and Æ 674\% for the time periods, respectively. This relationship appeared to be driven by the amount of the SOC stock change; changes in stocks that exceeded 200 Gg C yrÀ1 represented a threshold where uncertainties were always lower than Æ 100\%. Consequently, the amount of uncertainty in estimates derived from process-based models will partly depend on the level of SOC accumulation or loss. In general, the majority of uncertainty was associated with model structure in this application, and so attaining higher levels of precision in the estimates will largely depend on improving the model algorithms and parameterization, as well as increasing the number of measurement sites used to evaluate the structural uncertainty.},

  abstract = {We analyzed climatic and textural controls of soil organic C and N for soils of the U.S. Great Plains. We used a model of soil organic matter (SOM) quantity and composition to simulate steady­state organic matter levels for 24 grassland locations in the Great Plains. The model was able to simulate the effects of climatic gradients on SOM and productivity. Soil texture was also a major control over organic matter dynamics. The model adequately predicted above­ ground plant production and soil C and N levels across soil textures (sandy, medium, and fine); however, the model tended to overesti­ mate soil C and N levels for fine textured soil by 10 to 15\%. The impact of grazing on the system was simulated and showed that steady­state soil C and N levels were sensitive to the grazing inten­ sity, with soil C and N levels decreasing with increased grazing rates. Regional trends in SOM can be predicted using four site­ specific variables,temperature,moisture, soil texture, and plant lig­ nin content. Nitrogen inputs must also be known. Grazing intensity during soil development is also a significant control over steady­ state levels of SOM, and since few data are available on presettle­ ment grazing, some uncertainty is inherent in the model predictions.},

Slurry with nearly 10\% TSw was storedfrom January to October (285 days) in two tanks and, similarly, from June to November (146 days). Slurry samples were periodically collected from each of the tanks at two locations at depths of O'3, 1"0, 1"8 and 2"5m below the surface. Slurry TS\textasciitilde{} were determined by high-speed centrifuging. Substantial spatial and temporal concentration variations occurred in slurry TS\textasciitilde, TS\textasciitilde, FS and VS. Most of the concentration change and loss of TSw, TS\textasciitilde{} and VS was limited to the top I m of the slurry. Settling of solids did not appear to be an important process in the stored slurry. Large concentration changes were limited to the top 0"3 m only for about 6 months after winter and 3 months after summer-filling of the tanks. Thus, most of the initial organic matter and biogas generation potential was probably retained in the slurry at depths of I m or more. The rate and location of TS\textasciitilde{} concentration decreases suggested that VS biodegradation occurred mainly due to aerobic processes, starting near the surface and progressing downwards with time. Mass balances indicated that about one quarter of the initial TS\textasciitilde, VS and TC were lost by the end of the storage period in all tanks. Correlations between TS,. and TS,,, and between wet-basis TC and TSw or TS,,, were highly significant.},

  abstract = {The literature was reviewed and analyzed to determine the feasibility of using a combination of acid hydrolysis and CO2–C release during long-term incubation to determine soil organic carbon (SOC) pool sizes and mean residence times (MRTs). Analysis of 1100 data points showed the SOC remaining after hydrolysis with 6 M HCl ranged from 30 to 80\% of the total SOC depending on soil type, depth, texture, and management. Nonhydrolyzable carbon (NHC) in conventional till soils represented 48\% of SOC; no-till averaged 56\%, forest 55\%, and grassland 56\%. Carbon dates showed an average of 1200 yr greater MRT for the NHC fraction than total SOC. Longterm incubation, involving measurement of CO2 evolution and curve fitting, measured active and slow pools. Active-pool C comprised 2 to 8\% of the SOC with MRTs of days to months; the slow pool comprised 45 to 65\% of the SOC and had MRTs of 10 to 80 yr. Comparison of field 14C and 13C data with hydrolysis–incubation data showed a high correlation between independent techniques across soil types and experiments. There were large differences in MRTs depending on the length of the experiment. Insertion of hydrolysis–incubation derived estimates of active (Ca), slow (Cs), and resistant pools (Cr) into the DAYCENT model provided estimates of daily field CO2 evolution rates. These were well correlated with field CO2 measurements. Although not without some interpretation problems, acid hydrolysis–laboratory incubation is useful for determining SOC pools and fluxes especially when used in combination with associated measurements.},

  abstract = {To study the effects of organic matter and fertilizer additions on soil organic-matter (SOM) dynamics, we analyzed results from a 30yr-old Swedish field experiment, using the CENTURY model. Field treatments on a sandy clay loam included biannual addition (up to 4000 kg C ha'1) of straw, sawdust, and no organic additions, with and without N fertilizer (80 kg N ha\textasciitilde '), and green manure, farmyard manure, and bare fallow. Soil C and N, crop production (small-grain and root crops), N uptake, and mineralization and immobilization of N were modeled and compared with field measurements. Changes in soil C and N, as much as 30\% after 30 yr, were generally well represented by the model. Most of the treatment differences in SOM could be explained by the rate of organic-matter input, its lignin content, and C/N ratio, plus the effect of N fertilizer on below-ground C inputs. However, there appeared to be additional positive effects of N supply on SOM accumulation that were not fully explained by the model. The quality of organic amendments strongly influenced N uptake and crop productivity, through controls on N mineralization and immobilization. Mean annual N uptake ranged from a low of 3.1 g m\textasciitilde 2 in sawdust-amended soil to a high of 9.2 g m\textasciitilde 2 in fertilized, strawamended soil. Simulated N losses accounted for 7 to 20\% of total N inputs. Nitrogen-balance estimates by the model were consistent with the observed data for four of the treatments, but treatments with low N availability appeared to have additional, unexplained N inputs.},

  abstract = {Land application of organic waste is an important alternative to landfilling and incineration because it helps restore soil fertility and has environmental and agronomic benefits. These benefits may be related to the biochemical composition of the waste, which can result in the accumulation of different types of carbon compounds in soil. The objective of this study was to identify and characterise changes in soil organic matter (SOM) composition after repeated applications of organic waste. Soil from the CRUCIAL field experiment in Denmark was sampled after 12 years of annual application of household waste compost, cattle manure and sewage sludge, and was compared to a control treatment that had received NPK fertilisation. Soils were characterised using CO2-evolved gas analysis (CO2-EGA) during ramped thermal analysis, mid-infrared photoacoustic spectroscopy (FTIR-PAS) and analysis of amino-sugar and lignin phenols. SOM from the compost and cattle manure treatments had greater thermal stability than the sludge and NPK treatments, which was consistent with the thermal stability of the applied wastes. Compost-amended soils and manure-amended soils also had a greater lignin content with a lower degree of oxidation and a greater contribution of bacterial amino sugars relative to fungal amino sugars compared to soils from the NPK treatment. The high soil C accumulation rate combined with low amino sugar C in SOM from the compost treatment suggested less stimulation of microbial activity, while the cattle manure seemed to result in both microbial stimulation and accumulation of thermally stable forms of C. FTIR-PAS revealed greater C¼O vibration of carboxylic groups and amides in sludge and NPK treatments, indicating more oxidised SOM and the presence of proteins. Taken together, these results show that there was accumulation in soil of different C compounds for the different types of applied organic waste, which appeared to be related to the degree to which microbial activity was stimulated and the type of microbial communities applied with the wastes or associated with the decomposition of applied wastes. This in turn may have important effects on ecosystem functioning and long-term soil C storage.},

  abstract = {Multi-compartment soil carbon (C) simulation models such as RothC are widely used for predicting changes in C stocks of arable soils. However, rigorous routines for establishing entry pools that account for the diversity of exogenous organic matter (EOM) applied to croplands are still lacking. We obtained data on changes in soil C stocks after repeated applications of EOM from four long-term experiments (LTEs): Askov K2 (Denmark, 31 yrs), Qualiagro (France, 11 yrs), SERAIL (France, 14 yrs) and Ultuna (Sweden, 52 yrs). The adjustment of the partition coefficients of total organic C in EOM (EOM-TOC) into the labile, resistant and humified entry pools of RothC (fDPM, fRPM, fHUM, respectively) provided a successful fit to the accumulation of EOM-derived C in the LTE soils. Equations estimating the EOM partition coefficients in the RothC model were based on an indicator (IROC) of the EOM-TOC potentially retained in soil. IROC was derived from the C found in the soluble, lignin þ cutin-like and cellulose-like Van Soest fractions and the proportion of EOM-TOC mineralized during 3 days of incubation. Using the EOM partition coefficients derived from these laboratory analyses resulted in RothC simulations with only slightly larger errors than simulations based on partition coefficients fitted from LTE soil data, except for EOMs that caused very large accumulations of C in soil (e.g. peat) possibly due to factors not accounted for in the RothC model, such as change in soil pH. The proposed partitioning of EOM-TOC allows the potential soil C storage after EOM applications to be predicted regardless of field location and specific composition of EOMs.},

  abstract = {Solid pig manure (240 g kg−" DM) and solid cattle manure (150–180 g kg−" DM) were stored in an open storage facility during spring–summer and autumn conditions for periods of 9–14 weeks during 1994 and 1995. Concentrations of C, N, P and K were determined prior to and after storage, corrected for dry matter losses and distance from the surface. Temperature and, in experiments with pig manure, gas phase composition inside the manure heap were monitored during storage. Nitrogen losses as ammonia volatilization, nitrous oxide emission and leaching were measured, while total denitrification was estimated from mass balance calculations. For both cattle and pig manure there was little difference between seasons with respect to the pattern of decomposition, as reflected in temperature dynamics and C\textbackslash N turnover. In contrast, there was a distinct difference between manure types. Pig manure was characterized by maximum temperatures of 60–70 mC, although the concentrations of oxygen and methane clearly demonstrated that anaerobic conditions dominated the interior parts of the heap for several weeks. Losses of C and N from pig manure both amounted to c. 50 \%. In contrast, the temperature of cattle manure remained close to the air temperature throughout the storage period and cattle manure had lower, not significant losses of C and N. Leaching losses of N constituted 1–4 \% with both manure types. Ammonia volatilization from cattle manure constituted 4–5 \% of total N, and from pig manure 23–24 \%. In pig manure a similar amount of N (23–33 \%) could not be accounted for after storage, a loss that was attributed to denitrification. Nitrous oxide emissions amounted to 2 \% of estimated denitrification losses.},

  abstract = {Reliable quantification of the sources and sinks of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2), including that of their trends and uncertainties, is essential to monitoring the progress in mitigating anthropogenic emissions under the Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Agreement. This study provides a consolidated synthesis of estimates for all anthropogenic and natural sources and sinks of CO2 for the European Union and UK (EU27 + UK), derived from a combination of state-of-the-art bottom-up (BU) and top-down (TD) data sources and models. Given the wide scope of the work and the variety of datasets involved, this study focuses on identifying essential questions which need to be answered to properly understand the differences between various datasets, in particular with regards to the less-well-characterized fluxes from managed ecosystems. The work integrates recent emission inventory data, process-based ecosystem model results, data-driven sector model results and inverse modeling estimates over the period 1990–2018. BU and TD products are compared with European national greenhouse gas inventories (NGHGIs) reported under the UNFCCC in 2019, aiming to assess and understand the differences between approaches. For the uncertainties in NGHGIs, we used the standard deviation obtained by varying parameters of inventory calculations, reported by the member states following the IPCC Guidelines. Variation in estimates produced with other methods, like atmospheric inversion models (TD) or spatially disaggregated inventory datasets (BU), arises from diverse sources including within-model uncertainty related to parameterization as well as structural differences between models. In comparing NGHGIs with other approaches, a key source of uncertainty is that related to different system boundaries and emission categories (CO2 fossil) and the use of different land use definitions for reporting emissions from land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF) activities (CO2 land). At the EU27 + UK level, the NGHGI (2019) fossil CO2 emissions (including cement production) account for 2624 Tg CO2 in 2014 while all the other seven bottom-up sources are consistent with the NGHGIs and report a mean of 2588 (± 463 Tg CO2). The inversion reports 2700 Tg CO2 (± 480 Tg CO2), which is well in line with the national inventories. Over 2011–2015, the CO2 land sources and sinks from NGHGI estimates report −90 Tg C yr−1 ± 30 Tg C yr−1 while all other BU approaches report a mean sink of −98 Tg C yr−1 (± 362 Tg of C from dynamic global vegetation models only). For the TD model ensemble results, we observe a much larger spread for regional inversions (i.e., mean of 253 Tg C yr−1 ± 400 Tg C yr−1). This concludes that (a) current independent approaches are consistent with NGHGIs and (b) their uncertainty is too large to allow a verification because of model differences and probably also because of the definition of “CO2 flux” obtained from different approaches.

  abstract = {Decomposing crop residues contribute to soil organic matter (SOM) accrual; however, the factors driving the fate of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) in soil fractions are still largely unknown, especially the influence of soil mineralogy and autochthonous organic matter concentration. The objectives of this work were (1) to evaluate the retention of C and N from crop residue in the form of occluded and mineral-associated SOM in topsoil (0–20 cm) and subsoil (30–70 cm) previously incubated for 51 days with 13C-15N-labelled corn residues, and (2) to explore if specific minerals preferentially control the retention of residue-derived C and N in topsoil and subsoil. We used topsoil and subsoil having similar texture and mineralogy as proxies for soils being rich (i.e., topsoil) and poor (i.e., subsoil) in autochthonous organic matter. We performed a sequential density fractionation procedure and measured residue-derived C and N in occluded and mineral-associated SOM fractions, and used X-ray diffraction analysis of soil density fractions to investigate their mineralogy. In accordance with our hypothesis, the retention of C and N from crop residue through organo-mineral interactions was greater in subsoil than topsoil. The same minerals were involved in the retention of residue-derived organic matter in topsoil and subsoil, but the residue-derived organic matter was associated with a denser fraction in the subsoil (i.e., 2.5–2.6 g cm−3) than in the topsoil (i.e., 2.3–2.5 g cm−3). In soils and soil horizons with high clay content and reactive minerals, we find that a low SOM concentration leads to the rapid stabilization of C and N from newly added crop residues.},

  abstract = {The mineralization/immobilization of nitrogen when organic sources are added to soil is represented in many simulation models as the outcome of decomposition of the added material and synthesis of soil organic matter. These models are able to capture the pattern of N release that is attributable to the N concentration of plant materials, or more generally the C:N ratio of the organic input. However, the models are unable to simulate the more complex pattern of N release that has been observed for some animal manures, notably materials that exhibit initial immobilization of N even when the C:N of the material suggests it should mineralize N. The APSIM SoilN module was modified so that the three pools that constitute added organic matter could be specified in terms of both the fraction of carbon in each pool and also their C:N ratios (previously it has been assumed that all pools have the same C:N ratio). It is shown that the revised model is better able to simulate the general patterns on N mineralized that has been reported for various organic sources. By associating the model parameters with measured properties (the pool that decomposes most rapidly equates with water-soluble C and N; the pool that decomposes slowest equates with lignin-C) the model performed better than the unmodified model in simulating the N mineralization from a range of feeds and faecal materials measured in an incubation experiment.},

  abstract = {Soils represent a very complex material where mineral, organic and biological components interact together to form a large ‘biogeochemical interface’. In order to study this complex interface in a simplified system, a so-called ‘artificial soil’ incubation experiment was carried out. This experiment was used here specifically to study the effect of microbial activity and mineral interactions on the aggregation occurring during incubation. Artificial soils with different mineral composition but the same texture, were composed of well-defined model materials. The materials considered were quartz, illite, montmorillonite, ferrihydrite, boehmite and charcoal, manure as an organic matter (OM) source and a microbial inoculum extracted from a natural arable topsoil. The artificial soils were incubated for 3 to 18 months in the dark, under constant temperature and water content. The pH, organic carbon (OC) and nitrogen content, extractable Fe, Al and Si of the incubated artificial soils were measured, and the amount of macroaggregates {$>$} 2 mm was determined by sieving. Density fractionation was performed at densities of 1.8 and 2.4 g cm−3 to separate particulate OM, organomineral associates and the mineral fraction. The specific surface area (SSA) of the organo-mineral associate fraction and the amount of OC associated with organo-mineral associates and minerals was determined. The SSA of the model materials and the artificial soils at the start of incubation was determined by BET-N2. The artificial soils developed quickly and CO2 respiration occurred during the entire 18 month incubation time. The actual SSA of the ‘soils’ was significantly lower than the sum of the SSA of the pure model materials indicating that occlusion of mineral surfaces by interaction between OM and minerals occurred almost immediately after incubation started. Macroaggregates and organo-mineral associates were formed within 3 months of incubation. Macroaggregation decreased after 12 months of incubation probably due to decreasing biological activity. The turnover of macroaggregates and continuing formation of organo-mineral associates was consistent with the aggregate hierarchy model. Less macroaggregation was observed in the soil where no clay mineral was present, indicating that clay minerals were important for the formation of macroaggregates. Ferrihydrite and boehmite did not affect the aggregation or formation of organo-mineral associates in this experiment. The results of density fractionation indicate that OM was mainly associated with the clay minerals, probably due to the neutral pH of the artificial soils, leading to a low or negative surface charge of the oxides. The artificial soil incubation experiment showed that interface development and the building of macroaggregates and organo-mineral associates took place within a relatively short time scale. It offers a valuable model where the formation and interactions of soil properties and processes can be studied in a well-defined system.},

Here we show that these predictions, which range between 240 and 450 million hectares (Mha), underestimate the potential extension of irrigation by ignoring basic parametric and model uncertainties. We found that the probability distribution of global irrigated areas in 2050 spans almost half an order of magnitude (∼300–800 Mha, P2.5, P97.5), with the right tail pushing values to up to ∼1,800 Mha. This uncertainty is mostly irreducible as it is largely caused by either population-related parameters or the assumptions behind the model design. Model end-users and policy makers should acknowledge that irrigated areas are likely to grow much more than previously thought in order to avoid underestimating potential environmental costs.},

  abstract = {Although sensitivity analysis (SA) was conducted on the DeNitrificationeDeComposition (DNDC) model, a global SA over a long period of time is lacking. We used a method of Bayesian analysis of computer code outputs (BACCO) with the Gaussian emulation machine for sensitivity analysis software (GEM-SA) to conduct a long-term SA of DNDC for predicting the annual change of soil organic carbon (dSOC), nitrous oxide emission (N2O) and grain yield of spring wheat. Twenty seven non-weather input parameters with wide ranges were selected for SA using weather data recorded from Three Hills, Alberta over 86 years (1921e2006). The SA had two steps: 1) a preliminary BACCO GEM-SA was conducted to identify a more accurate emulator sampling method and to screen out parameters with insignificant influence on model outcomes; and 2) final BACCO GEM-SA was conducted with optimal input design set for emulator training runs varying only the significant input parameters. Results indicated that the Maximin Latin Hypercube sampling method outperformed the LP-s method with higher emulator accuracy. Most of the 27 input parameters contributed little to the three outputs by the first step BACCO GEM-SA. In the second step of BACCO GEM-SA there were only three (in the case of dSOC) and six (in the cases of N2O and yield) input parameters whose influence contributed to more than 10\% of the total output variances by their total effects. Among the selected parameters, initial soil organic carbon and clay content are very important and were important in determining results for all three outputs. Sensitivities of some parameters, such as clay content and urea fertilizer amount changed dramatically over the years. This indicates that a single year SA may overestimate or underestimate a long-term parameter effect on the model prediction. The two-step procedure with the BACCO GEM-SA method improved the accuracy of SA and provided important information for model validation and parameterization.},

  abstract = {Soil organic matter (SOM) is valuable, because of both its beneficial effect on soil quality and crop productivity and its potential to sequester C. Long-term experiments provide an opportunity to identify crop management practices that enhance or degrade soil quality. This study was initiated in 1931 to determine residue management effects on crop yield and SOM (organic C and N) in a winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)-fallow system. The soil is a coarse-silty, mixed, mesic Typic Haploxeroll. Treatments include (units ha \textasciitilde ' crop\textasciitilde ') 22.4 Mg manure, 2.24 Mg pea vine residue, 0, 45, and 90 kg N with and without spring burning of straw, and 0 kg N with fall burning of straw. Yearly C and N inputs and removals have been determined since 1976, and calculated for prior periods. Soil C and N have been determined at = 11-yr intervals. Manure, which supplies 111 kg N ha"1 crop"1, has consistently produced the highest yield and maintained the highest soil C and N contents. Other treatments initially yielded from 80 to 90\% of the manure treatment, but have progressively declined in direct relation to decreasing soil N content. Low-fertility treatments currently yield from 43 to 57\% of the manure treatment. The change in soil C and N with time is nearly linear for all treatments, and highly correlated with residue input. Treatment effects on soil C and N have been confined to the top 30 cm of soil, but there has been a slow steady decline in C and N in the 30- to 60-cm zone that is not related to residue management.},

  abstract = {Soil microbial biomass carbon (SMBC) and nitrogen (SMBN) are important indices of soil bio-fertility. While intensively managed cropping systems can reduce microbial biomass, application of manure is a potential way to rebuilt microbial biomass and improve soil functions. However, the responses of SMBC and SMBN to manure application relative to mineral fertilizers (NPK) in Chinese cropping systems remains unclear. We conducted a meta-analysis based on 103 peer-reviewed publications with 1448 paired observations to identify the degree to which climate types, soil properties and agricultural managements regulate the responses of microbial biomass to manure amendment relative to NPK. The results indicated that manure application increased SMBC, SMBN, SMBC/soil organic carbon (SOC) and SMBN/soil total nitrogen (TN) by 40\%, 55\%, 16\% and 21\%, respectively, across all the observations compared to NPK. SMBC/SMBN under manure amendment (6.58 in average) was lower than that in NPK (7.86 in average). Manure-related factors, e.g. manure types, duration of application, manure-C and N input rates, were the strongest regulators of the response of microbial biomass. Soil properties and climates also contributed to considerable degrees of variation in microbial biomass response based on variance partitioning analysis (VPA). Results of the random forest (RF) models showed that manure type, application rate (manure-C and N input) as well as soil initial properties (SOC, TN and clay contents) were likely the predominant factors controlling the response of microbial biomass to manure application. Our study indicates that manure application can be an effective way to restore the loss of microbial biomass due to intensive application of NPK, yet variations in response are determined by specific manure type, application rate, as well as local conditions of climate and inherent soil properties.},

  abstract = {Application of livestock manure has been recognized as an important strategy for enhancing soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks. However, the magnitude of manure application impacts on SOC changes as compared with conventional mineral fertilizers still needs to be better assessed. In this study, we conducted a meta-analysis to address the effects of various fertilization practices on SOC changes in China's arable topsoil. The analysis was based on 148 peer reviewed articles reporting 69 sites and 729 observations with an average experimental duration of 18 years across China. We compared the response of SOC content to application of manure alone (M) or manure plus mineral fertilizers (NPKM) with the SOC response to NPK or no fertilizers (Control). We systematically analyzed how SOC responses were influenced by different environmental and management factors (land use, climate and soil properties, etc.). First, the retention coefficient of manure was used to present the percentage of C input from manure “converted” to SOC. Compared to Control, on average, manure had Cretention coefficients of 31\% ± 12\% (95\% Confidence Interval, CI) and 18\% ± 2\% for the experimental duration of ≤10 years and {$>$} 10 years, respectively. When compared to NPK, manure had C-retention coefficients of 29\% ± 13\% and 9\% ± 3\% for the experimental duration of ≤10 years and {$>$} 10 years, respectively. In addition, compared to Control and NPK, application of manure increased SOC content by 0.23–0.26 and 0.18–0.19 g kg−1 yr−1, respectively. The results also indicated that the mean differences of SOC change between the treatments with or without manure application were mainly controlled by soil properties (28–43\%) and anthropogenic farming practices (21–27\%). Our results highlight the significance of improving or maintaining SOC stocks by manure applications, and provide insights for making manure application recommendations or guidelines to improve SOC stocks of China's cropland based on soil properties, climatic conditions and management practices.},

Both potentially mineralizable C and the mineralization rate (k) varied considerably among soils, reflecting the differences in soil properties. Potentially mineralizable C was positively related to C evolved as CO2 and to the exchange capacity. Normalized values (potentially mineralizable C divided by organic C), representing on average about 2\% of the total soil C, was positively correlated to soil pH and negatively to the soil C pool, the soil N pool, and total microbial activity. Values for k ranged between 0.050 and 0.104 day-a, being higher in fine-textured soils and in soils with a large free Fe content. A low C:N ratio was indicative of a high k value. Turnover times for mineralized C were relatively rapid, ranging from 10 to 20 days.},

We then estimated the required increase in organic carbon (OC) input to preserve or increase SOC stocks. Results Projected SOC stocks of German croplands are estimated to decline under current OC input levels and management, both with and without climate change. Depending on the climate scenario, we estimated that the OC input to the soil in 2099 needs to be between 51\% (+ 1.3 Mg ha− 1) and 93\% (+ 2.3 Mg ha− 1) higher than today to preserve current SOC stock levels. A SOC stock increase of 34.4\% (4‰ a− 1) would even require an OC input increase of between 221\% (+ 5.5 Mg ha− 1) and 283\% (+ 7.1 Mg ha− 1). Conclusions Our study highlights that under climate change increasing SOC stocks is considerable challenging since projected SOC losses have to be compensated},

  abstract = {The growing number of biogas plants in Europe has resulted in increased production of nutrient-rich digestate with great potential as fertilizer for arable land. The nutrient composition of digestate varies with the substrate treated in the biogas plant and may contain compounds that stimulate or inhibit soil microbial activity. This study compared 20 digestates (D) with 10 pig slurries (PS) and 10 cow manures (CM) regarding their chemical content and their effect on soil microbial activities, i.e. potential ammonia oxidation rate (PAO) and soil respiration. The results showed no significant differences within the D group when divided based on substrate type. i.e. manure dominated vs. other organic waste materials in any of the tests. In general D contained significantly higher concentrations of ammonium while the concentrations of total carbon and volatile fatty acids were higher in PS and CM than in D. The D showed both stimulating and inhibiting effects on PAO, while all CM and all PS except one showed inhibiting effects on PAO. However, PAO activity was negatively correlated with the content of volatile fatty acids in the residues indicating that these compounds may be the cause of the inhibition. The maximum respiration activity (hpeakmax) was lower and the time point for the maximum respiration activity (tpeakmax) occurred earlier for D compared with CM and PS. This earlier peak time could be indicative of a high proportion of easily degradable carbon in D compared with PS and CM. However, the utilization rate of carbon, i.e. the proportion of added organic C converted to CO2-C during 12 days, did not differ significantly between D, PS and CM, indicating that overall carbon quality in the different fertilizers was still roughly comparable. In short, our results suggest that digestates were different compared with PS and CM but without posing a higher risk with respect to their impact on soil microbial activity.},

Application of manure and fertilizer affects the rate and extent of mineralization and sequestration of C in soil. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of 3 yr of application of N fertilizer and different manure amendments on CO2 evolution and the dynamics of soil microbial biomass and soluble C in the field. Soil respiration, soluble organic C and microbial biomass C were measured at intervals over the growing season in maize soils amended with stockpiled or rotted manure, N fertilizer (200 kg N ha–1) and with no amendments (control). Manure amendments increased soil respiration and levels of soluble organic C and microbial biomass C by a factor of 2 to 3 compared with the control, whereas the N fertilizer had little effect on any parameter. Soil temperature explained most of the variations in CO2 flux (78 and to 95\%) in each treatment, but data from all treatments could not be fitted soluble C resulting from manure amendments were strongly correlated (r2 to a unique relationship. Increases = 0.75) with soil temperature. This in CO2 emission observation confirms that soluble C is an active C pool affected by biological activity. The positive correlation between soluble organic C and soil temperature also suggests that production of soluble C increases more than mineralization of soluble C as temperature increases. The total manure-derived CO2-C C. Estimates of average turnover was equivalent to rates of microbial 52\% of the applied stockpiled-manure C and 67\% of the applied biomass ranged between 0.72 and 1.22 yr–1 and were lowest in rotted-manure manured soils. Manured soils also had large quantities of soluble C with a slower turnover rate than that in either fertilized or unamended soils.},

  abstract = {Establishing the long-term effects of different types of animal manures on soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks has both agronomic and environmental implications. However, only a few studies have analyzed the effects of the types of animal manure on SOC storage in subsurface soil layers. Furthermore, the effect of animal manure on labile and stable soil organic matter (SOM) fractions has been scarcely reported for subtropical no-till soils. We evaluated the effect of animal manure application in the short and long term (4 and 12 years) on SOC storage at different depths throughout a 0–70 cm soil profile and on the physical fractions of SOM in the 0–20 cm layer of a sandy Alfisol cropped under no-tillage. The study involved five treatments: pig deep-litter (PDL), cattle slurry (CS), pig slurry (PS), mineral fertilizer (MF) and a control without fertilization (CL). The SOC stock in the soil profile (0–70 cm) was influenced by manure application in only the long term, which was due to high SOC accumulation in the surface (0–20 cm) in the short-and long-term. The PDL and CS applications resulted in 16\% (8.6 Mg ha− 1) and 10\% (5.2 Mg ha− 1) increases in the SOC stock, respectively, compared with those in the CL, but only PDL resulted in greater SOC stocks than MF. These results are related to the greater C addition and higher SOC retention coefficient with the PDL application (17\%) than with the CS (15\%) and PS (7\%) appli­ cations. Most of the manure-induced changes were observed in the silt plus clay-sized heavy fraction (SCHF), with PDL and CS being more efficient at increasing SOC storage as organic-mineral complexes than PS or MF in the 0–20 cm soil layer. However, in the subsurface layer (20–70 cm), manure caused a decrease in SOC compared with that in the CL, resulting in negative SOC storage rates in this layer, which partially or completely neutralized the SOC storage rates observed in the surface layer (0–20 cm). In the long term, this condition resulted in SOC storage rates in the 0–70 cm soil profile of 0.48 Mg ha− 1 year− 1 for PDL, 0.21 Mg ha− 1 year− 1 for CS, − 0.03 Mg ha− 1 year− 1 for PS and 0.01 Mg ha− 1 year− 1 for MF. These results indicate that PDL and CS are suitable alter­ natives to MF for increasing the SOC stock and that the SOC retention is greater with solid manure than with liquid manure (PDL vs CS and PS) and with CS than with PS. Moreover, the results reveal the importance of monitoring SOC changes in the long term and within deep soil layers to better quantify the effects of successive applications of animal manure on SOC storage potential in subtropical sandy soils under no-tillage.},

  abstract = {Dairy farms have been identified as an important source of greenhouse gas emissions. Within the farm, important emissions include enteric CH4 from the animals, CH4 and N2O from manure in housing facilities during long-term storage and during field application, and N2O from nitrification and denitrification processes in the soil used to produce feed crops and pasture. Models using a wide range in level of detail have been developed to represent or predict these emissions. They include constant emission factors, variable processrelated emission factors, empirical or statistical models, mechanistic process simulations, and life cycle assessment. To fully represent farm emissions, models representing the various emission sources must be integrated to capture the combined effects and interactions of all important components. Farm models have been developed using relationships across the full scale of detail, from constant emission factors to detailed mechanistic simulations. Simpler models, based upon emission factors and empirical relationships, tend to provide better tools for decision support, whereas more complex farm simulations provide better tools for research and education. To look beyond the farm boundaries, life cycle assessment provides an environmental accounting tool for quantifying and evaluating emissions over the full cycle, from producing the resources used on the farm through processing, distribution, consumption, and waste handling of the milk and dairy products produced. Models are useful for improving our understanding of farm processes and their interacting effects on greenhouse gas emissions. Through better understanding, they assist in the development and evaluation of mitigation strategies for reducing emissions and improving overall sustainability of dairy farms.},

An optimality research program has a lengthy history and record of success in the field of behavioural ecology, but has been seldom employed in fungal ecology. We discuss the ORP and provide some examples of how optimality models may be useful in fungal ecology. We suggest that such an approach may benefit experimental fungal ecologists by: providing a framework for organizing knowledge; generating hypotheses; helping in the planning of experiments; aiding in the interpretation of results; and directing the next steps of an experimental research program. We illustrate these benefits by sketching out how an ORP might be used to answer some fundamental questions about the interactions between host plants and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi.},

  abstract = {A few management tools can simultaneously describe dissolved and particulate P losses from agricultural fields. In this study a phosphorus (P) management tool was developed based on most recent scientific findings to meet this need, and it was subsequently incorporated into Root Zone Water Quality Model 2 (RZWQM2) to take advantage of its featured hydrologic and agricultural management subroutines. The RZWQM2-P model was evaluated against data collected in a tile-drained corn-soybean rotated field fertilized with inorganic P at South Woodslee, Ontario. The results indicate that overall the model satisfactorily simulated dissolved reactive P and particulate P losses through surface runoff and tile drainage with Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient {$>$} 0.65, percent bias within 25\% and index of agreement {$>$} 0.75. RZWQM2-P is a promising tool for P management, particularly for subsurface-drained fields. Further testing is needed to assess its performance under different fertilization (manure), soil, climate, and cropping conditions.},

The WSPS showed a CO2 release of up to 23\% above that predicted by summing the CO2 evolved from WS and PS. Of the several kinetic models tested to describe the mineralization process, a double exponential model best described the C mineralization of all the materials, both intact and with extractions. The extraction of the labile substances from WS, PS and WSPS lowered the values of the rapidly mineralizable C and of the amount of microbial biomass. The organic fraction of WS was found to be almost completely represented by mineralizable carbon, while PS and WSPS showed only 62\% of mineralizable carbon. In spite of this, after 8 months, about half of the initial amount of the organic C in the intact residues still remained unmineralized.},

  abstract = {A total of 331 different VOCs and fixed gases from swine facilities in North Carolina were identified by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Of these, 203 were found in air samples adsorbed onto Tenax®, 112 were found in air samples adsorbed onto cotton material, and 167 different compounds were identified in the lagoon samples. The compounds identified were diverse, and included many acids, alcohols, aldehydes, amides, amines, aromatics, esters, ethers, fixed gases, halogenated hydrocarbons, hydrocarbons, ketones, nitriles, other nitrogen-containing compounds, phenols, sulfur-containing compounds, steroids, and other compounds. The vast majority of these compounds were present at concentrations below published odor and irritation thresholds. Yet human assessments indicated that odors (and irritant sensations) in the immediate vicinity of the swine houses (and even at distances beyond 1000 ft) were strong. Comparison of the findings from chemical and human assessments points to the importance of the cumulative effects of hundreds of compounds in producing odor and irritation downwind of swine operations. Many GC peaks from the samples were too small to allow identification of the compounds, but their presence may also contribute significantly to the odor and irritation. Several methodological difficulties were associated with the human odor assessments. Odorous air evaluated in the field was simultaneously collected in Tedlar® bags for evaluation in the laboratory; however, intensity ratings in the field were higher than those in the laboratory. This is due to the fact that organic dust (dried fecal material and feed) adheres to Tedlar® bags and the tubing of collection/delivery systems; therefore, only VOCs from the vapor phase (but not the dust) reach the nose of the panelists in sniffing air samples obtained in Tedlar® bags. Future collection and measurement techniques need to be developed that can evaluate odors from dust and vapor phases simultaneously in the laboratory. Dispersion models also need to be developed that account accurately for odor intensities downwind of animal operations. Finally, safety standards for odor exposures need to be determined that consider the risk of simultaneous exposure to hundreds of low level compounds. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

  abstract = {Our current understanding of the temperature response of biological processes in soil is based on the Arrhenius equation. This predicts an exponential increase in rate as temperature rises, whereas in the laboratory and in the field, there is always a clearly identifiable temperature optimum for all microbial processes. In the laboratory, this has been explained by denaturation of enzymes at higher temperatures, and in the field, the availability of substrates and water is often cited as critical factors. Recently, we have shown that temperature optima for enzymes and microbial growth occur in the absence of denaturation and that this is a consequence of the unusual heat capacity changes associated with enzymes. We have called this macromolecular rate theory – MMRT (Hobbs et al., 2013, ACS Chem. Biol. 8:2388). Here, we apply MMRT to a wide range of literature data on the response of soil microbial processes to temperature with a focus on respiration but also including different soil enzyme activities, nitrogen and methane cycling. Our theory agrees closely with a wide range of experimental data and predicts temperature optima for these microbial processes. MMRT also predicted high relative temperature sensitivity (as assessed by Q10 calculations) at low temperatures and that Q10 declined as temperature increases in agreement with data synthesis from the literature. Declining Q10 and temperature optima in soils are coherently explained by MMRT which is based on thermodynamics and heat capacity changes for enzyme-catalysed rates. MMRT also provides a new perspective, and makes new predictions, regarding the absolute temperature sensitivity of ecosystems – a fundamental component of models for climate change.},

  abstract = {Soil organic carbon (SOC) is believed to play a crucial role for many soil functions and ecosystem services. Despite much research, a lower threshold of SOC for sustainable crop production has not been identified across soil types. We addressed a comprehensive dataset with yields of winter wheat for nearly a 1000 field nitrogen (N) response experiments performed over 3 decades in Denmark. The soils ranged from coarse sand to clay loam (0.016–0.406 kg clay kgÀ1 minerals) with SOC ranging from 0.005 to 0.039 kg kgÀ1 minerals. All experiments were located on arable soil that was fully fertilized with all other plant nutrients. Based on the yield response at 4–6 levels of applied mineral N, we estimated the potential yield not restricted by any nutrient, Ypot, the yield at no applied N, YN0, the marginal agronomic efficiency (AEN0) in terms of the increase in yield per unit of applied N at zero N, and the level of mineral N, Nopt, needed to obtain Ypot. YN0 increased with Fines20 (proportion of soil minerals {$<$} 20 μm). AEN0 decreased with SOC independent of soil type. Nopt decreased with increase in SOC. Ypot increased significantly with a squared expression of Fines20 and decreased significantly with SOC. Ypot was better explained by RH ¼ Fines20/SOC than SOC per se. Our results indicate a positive effect of SOC in terms of a reduction of mineral N needed to obtain the potential crop yield, and a negative effect on Ypot. We suggest a multigate regulation concept for future studies addressing the non-N effect of SOC. We further draw attention to the importance of the quality of the SOC for better understanding effects on crop yields.},

  abstract = {Soil organic carbon (SOC) models such as the Rothamsted Carbon Model (RothC) have been used to estimate SOC dynamics in soils over different time scales but, until recently, their ability to accurately predict SOC stocks/carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from salt-affected soils has not been assessed. Given the large extent of salt-affected soils (19\% of the 20.8 billion ha of arable land on Earth), this may lead to miss-estimation of CO2 release. Using soils from two salt-affected regions (one in Punjab, India and one in South Australia), an incubation study was carried out measuring CO2 release over 120 days. The soils varied both in salinity (measured as electrical conductivity (EC) and calculated as osmotic potential using EC and water content) and sodicity (measured as sodium adsorption ratio, SAR). For soils from both regions, the osmotic potential had a significant positive relationship with CO2ÀC release, but no significant relationship was found between SAR and CO2ÀC release. The monthly cumulative CO2ÀC was simulated using RothC. RothC was modified to take into account reductions in plant inputs due to salinity. A subset of non-salt-affected soils was used to derive an equation for a “lab-effect” modifier to account for changes in decomposition under lab conditions and this modifier was significantly related with pH. Using a subset of salt-affected soils, a decomposition rate modifier (as a function of osmotic potential) was developed to match measured and modelled CO2ÀC release after correcting for the lab effect. Using this decomposition rate modifier, we found an agreement (R2 = 0.92) between modelled and independently measured data for a set of soils from the incubation experiment. RothC, modified by including reduced plant inputs due to salinity and the salinity decomposition rate modifier, was used to predict SOC stocks of soils in a field in South Australia. The predictions clearly showed that SOC stocks are reduced in saline soils. Therefore both the decomposition rate modifier and plant input modifier should be taken into account when accounting for SOC turnover in saline soils. Since modeling has previously not accounted for the impact of salinity, our results suggest that previous predictions may have overestimated SOC stocks.},

  abstract = {In salt-affected soils, soil organic carbon levels are usually low as a result of poor plant growth; additionally, decomposition of soil organic matter may be decreased. Thus, the CO2 evolution from salt-affected soils is likely to be lower than that from non-saline soils. Carbon models such as Rothamsted Carbon (RothC) that are used to estimate global CO2 emission do not consider the effect of salinity on CO2 emission. Given the large extent of salt-affected soils (19 percent of 20.8 billion hectares of arable land on Earth), this may lead to overestimation of CO2 release. Two laboratory incubation experiments were conducted to assess the effect of soil texture on response of CO2 release to salinity and to calculate a rate modifier for salinity in soil carbon models and study soil carbon dynamics: a sandy loam (18.8\% clay) and a sandy clay loam (22.5\% clay) in one experiment and a loamy sand (6.3 \% clay) and a clay loam (42 \% clay) in another experiment. Sodium chloride (NaCl) was used to develop a range of salinities viz. EC1:5 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0 and 5.0 dS/m. The soils were amended with 2\% wheat residues and CO2 emission was measured over 4 months. Cumulative CO2-C/g soil decreased with increased salinity. Cumulative CO2-C expressed as percent of the control soil (without salt addition) showed a lower impact of salinity on organic matter decomposition with increasing clay content. A decrease in particulate organic carbon (POC) associated with incubation was less in the higher saline soils whereas total organic carbon, humus-C and charcoal-C did not change over time and were not significantly affected by salinity. A significant exponential relationship was obtained between EC and the salt rate modifier, suggesting that a new salt rate modifier should be incorporated into RothC in order to accurately model CO2 emissions from salt-affected soils.},

  abstract = {A sensitivity analysis is critical for determining the relative importance of model parameters to their influence on the simulated outputs from a process-based model. In this study, a sensitivity analysis for the SPACSYS model, first published in Ecological Modelling (Wu, et al., 2007), was conducted with respect to changes in 61 input parameters and their influence on 27 output variables. Parameter sensitivity was conducted in a ‘one at a time’ manner and objectively assessed through a single statistical diagnostic (normalized root mean square deviation) which ranked parameters according to their influence of each output variable in turn. A winter wheat field experiment provided the case study data. Two sets of weather elements to represent different climatic conditions and four different soil types were specified, where results indicated little influence on these specifications for the identification of the most sensitive parameters. Soil conditions and management were found to affect the ranking of parameter sensitivities more strongly than weather conditions for the selected outputs. Parameters related to drainage were strongly influential for simulations of soil water dynamics, yield and biomass of wheat, runoff, and leaching from soil during individual and consecutive growing years. Wheat yield and biomass simulations were sensitive to the ‘ammonium immobilised fraction’ parameter that related to soil mineralization and immobilisation. Simulations of CO2 release from the soil and soil nutrient pool changes were most sensitive to external nutrient inputs and the process of denitrification, mineralization, and decomposition. This study provides important evidence of which SPACSYS parameters require the most care in their specification. Moving forward, this evidence can help direct efficient sampling and lab analyses for increased accuracy of such parameters. Results provide a useful reference for model users on which parameters are most influential for different simulation goals, which in turn provides better informed decision making for farmers and government policy alike.},

To link N-driven changes in SOM to microbial responses, we measured the potential activity of several extracellular enzymes involved in SOM degradation at nine experimental sites located in northern Michigan. Each site has three treatment plots (ambient, +30 and +80 kg N haÀ1 yÀ1). Litter and soil samples were collected on five dates over the third growing season of N treatment. Phenol oxidase, peroxidase and cellobiohydrolase activities showed significant responses to N additions. In the Acer saccharum–Tilia americana ecosystem, oxidative activity was 38\% higher in the litter horizon of high N treatment plots, relative to ambient plots, while oxidative activity in mineral soil showed little change. In the A. saccharum–Quercus rubra and Q. velutina–Q. alba ecosystems, oxidative activities declined in both litter (15 and 23\%, respectively) and soil (29 and 38\%, respectively) in response to high N treatment while cellobiohydrolase activity increased (6 and 39\% for litter, 29 and 18\% for soil, respectively). Over 3 years, SOM content in the high N plots has decreased in the Acer–Tilia ecosystem and increased in the two Quercus ecosystems, relative to ambient plots. For all three ecosystems, differences in SOM content in relation to N treatment were directly related (r2 = 0.92) to an enzyme activity factor that included both oxidative and hydrolytic enzyme responses.},

  abstract = {Extracellular enzymes mediate the degradation, transformation and mineralization of soil organic matter. The activity of cellulases, phosphatases and other hydrolases has received extensive study and in many cases stoichiometric relationships and responses to disturbances are well established. In contrast, phenol oxidase and peroxidase activities, which are often uncorrelated with hydrolase activities, have been measured in only a small subset of soil enzyme studies. These enzymes are expressed for a variety of purposes including ontogeny, defense and the acquisition of carbon and nitrogen. Through excretion or lysis, these enzymes enter the environment where their aggegrate activity mediates key ecosystem functions of lignin degradation, humification, carbon mineralization and dissolved organic carbon export. Phenol oxidases and peroxidases are less stable in the environment than extracellular hydrolases, especially when associated with organic particles. Activities are also affected, positively and negatively, by interaction with mineral surfaces. High spatiotemporal variation obscures their relationships with environmental variables and ecological process. Across ecosystems, phenol oxidase and peroxidase activities generally increase with soil pH, a finding not predicted from the pH optima of purified enzymes. Activities associated with plant litter and particulate organic matter often correlate with decomposition rates and potential activities generally increase with the lignin and secondary compound content of the material. At the ecosystem scale, nitrogen amendment alters the expression of phenol oxidase and peroxidase enzymes more broadly than culture studies imply and these responses correlate with positive and negative changes in litter decomposition rates and soil organic matter content. At the global scale, N amendment of basidiomycete-dominated soils of temperate and boreal forest ecoystems often leads to losses of oxidative enzyme activity, while activities in grassland soils dominated by glomeromycota and ascomycetes show little net response. Land use that leads to loss of soil organic matter tends to increase oxidative activities. Across ecosystems, soil organic matter content is not correlated with mean potential phenol oxidase and peroxidase activities. A multiple regression model that includes soil pH, mean annual temperature, mean annual precipitation and potential phenol oxidase activity accounts for 37\% of the variation in soil organic matter (SOM) content across ecosystems (n ¼ 63); a similar model for peroxidase activity describes 32\% of SOM variance (n ¼ 43). Analysis of residual variation suggest that suites of interacting factors create both positive and negative feedbacks on soil organic matter storage. Soils with high oxygen availability, pH and mineral activity tend to be substrate limited: high in situ oxidative activities limit soil organic matter accumulation. Soils with opposing characteristics are activity limited: low in situ oxidative activities promote soil organic matter storage.},

  abstract = {Soil disturbance from tillage is a major cause of organic matter depletion and reduction in the number and stability of soil aggregates when native ecosystems are converted to agriculture. No-till (NT) cropping systems usually exhibit increased aggregation and soil organic matter relative to conventional tillage (CT). However, the extent of soil organic matter changes in response to NT management varies between soils and the mechanisms of organic matter stabilization in NT systems are unclear. We evaluated a conceptual model which links the turnover of aggregates to soil organic matter dynamics in NT and CT systems; we argue that the rate of macroaggregate formation and degradation (i.e. aggregate turnover) is reduced under NT compared to CT and leads to a formation of stable microaggregates in which carbon is stabilized and sequestered in the long term. Therefore, the link between macroaggregate turnover, microaggregate formation, and C stabilization within microaggregates partly determines the observed soil organic matter increases under NT. q 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Replicate experimental plots of three different manure and fertilizer treatments and one unfertilized control object were sampled in March 2004 at both sites. Samples from all fields were separated into five size and density fractions. Fertilization had a distinct influence on both the OC amount present in two free particulate organic matter (POM) fractions (+19–230\% compared to the control treatment) and their relative proportion on the whole-soil OC. This increase in OC was equal or smaller for the POM occluded in microaggregates (53–250 ␮m) (+16–97\% compared to the control treatment), and much smaller for the amount of OC present in the silt + clay sized fraction (+ −2 to 30\% compared to the control treatment). The considered SOC fractions were associated with different conceptual SOC pools. Differences in the relative effect of management on the amount of OC present in the fractions consequently resulted in shifts of the relative proportion of the OC present in these conceptual OC pools. The measurability of these changes at the time scale of decades shows that it may be possible to use experimental data such as the data obtained from this study for the development and calibration of SOC models with conceptual OC pools which coincide with physical counterparts.},

  abstract = {Yearly, per-area carbon sequestration rates are used to estimate mitigation potentials by comparing types and areas of land management in 1990 and 2000 and projected to 2010, for the European Union (EU)-15 and for four country-level case studies for which data are available: UK, Sweden, Belgium and Finland. Because cropland area is decreasing in these countries (except for Belgium), and in most European countries there are no incentives in place to encourage soil carbon sequestration, carbon sequestration between 1990 and 2000 was small or negative in the EU-15 and all case study countries. Belgium has a slightly higher estimate for carbon sequestration than the other countries examined. This is at odds with previous reports of decreasing soil organic carbon stocks in Flanders. For all countries except Belgium, carbon sequestration is predicted to be negligible or negative by 2010, based on extrapolated trends, and is small even in Belgium. The only trend in agriculture that may be enhancing carbon stocks on croplands at present is organic farming, and the magnitude of this effect is highly uncertain. Previous studies have focused on the potential for carbon sequestration and have shown quite significant potential. This study, which examines the sequestration likely to occur by 2010, suggests that the potential will not be realized. Without incentives for carbon sequestration in the future, cropland carbon sequestration under Article 3.4 of the Kyoto Protocol will not be an option in EU-15.},

Comparisons were then conducted against the Root Zone Water Quality Model (RZWQM2), using measurements of soil water storage, runoff, and drainage in eastern Canada and the US Midwest. Simulation of soil water storage (DNDC 0.81 � d � 0.90; RZWQM2 0.76 � d � 0.84), daily water flow (DNDC 0.76 � d � 0.88; RZWQM2 0.77 � d � 0.90) and nitrogen loading to tile drains were improved post-development. DNDC was able to capture the observed differences in water and N losses between conventional drainage and controlled drainage management with sub-irrigation. The enhancements to DNDC’s hydrological framework should enable the development of improved biogeochemical processes.},

The Century model was used to estimate the influence of changing agricultural practices on C levels in seven major soil groups in Canada for the years from 2000 to 2010. Conversion of arable land to permanent cover, and inclusion of forages in crop rotations would result in the greatest sequestration of C, averaging 0.62 and 0.44 Mg C ha–1 yr–1, respectively. The increase in soil C when conventional-tillage is converted to no-tillage management was estimated to average about 0.13 Mg C ha–1 yr–1. Reduction of summerfallow (wheat-fallow to wheat-wheat-fallow) in the arid and semi-arid chernozems of Western Canada would reduce C losses by about 0.03 Mg C ha–1 yr–1. If fertilizer use efficiency was increased by 50\%, 0.04 Mg C ha–1 yr–1 would be sequestered, whereas a decrease of 50\% in fertilizer use efficiency would result in a loss of 0.05 Mg C ha–1 yr–1. Timing of N application (fall vs. spring) had little effect on C change. This study indicates that there are several feasible techniques that could be adopted by agricultural producers in Canada that would significantly increase CO2 uptake from the atmosphere. Although our estimates are based on changes in individual management options, we recognize that producers are likely to adopt several options at the same time. Any interactions resulting from such a move have not been assessed in this analysis, in particular the impact on N2O emissions.},

  abstract = {Soils are subject to varying degrees of direct or indirect human disturbance, constituting a major global change driver. Factoring out natural from direct and indirect human influence is not always straightforward, but some human activities have clear impacts. These include land-use change, land management and land degradation (erosion, compaction, sealing and salinization). The intensity of land use also exerts a great impact on soils, and soils are also subject to indirect impacts arising from human activity, such as acid deposition (sulphur and nitrogen) and heavy metal pollution. In this critical review, we report the state-of-the-art understanding of these global change pressures on soils, identify knowledge gaps and research challenges and highlight actions and policies to minimize adverse environmental impacts arising from these global change drivers. Soils are central to considerations of what constitutes sustainable intensification. Therefore, ensuring that vulnerable and high environmental value soils are considered when protecting important habitats and ecosystems, will help to reduce the pressure on land from global change drivers. To ensure that soils are protected as part of wider environmental efforts, a global soil resilience programme should be considered, to monitor, recover or sustain soil fertility and function, and to enhance the ecosystem services provided by soils. Soils cannot, and should not, be considered in isolation of the ecosystems that they underpin and vice versa. The role of soils in supporting ecosystems and natural capital needs greater recognition.},

The RSOM content of soils varies markedly between sites, and knowledge of its size and variability are essential for determining whether soils behave as sources or sinks of atmospheric CO2. It has also been suggested that the accurate specification of RSOM pools is essential to modelling studies, and that uncertainty in estimates of the size of RSOM pool could be a major source of error in modelling soil organic C. In this paper, current SOM models are reviewed, and approaches to modelling RSOM and its significance are discussed. Simulations of SOM turnover for the Rothamsted Broadbalk winter wheat experiment using the Rothamsted C model and CENTURY are presented as examples.},

Land use, management practices, soil characteristics, and climate in¯uence such changes. Using the Century model we estimated the rate of SOC change in agricultural soils of Canada for the period 1970 to 2010. This estimation was based on the estimated SOC change for 15\% of the 1250 agriculturally designated soil landscape of Canada (SLC) polygons. Simulations were carried out for two to ®ve crop rotations and for conventional and no-tillage. The results indicate that the agricultural soils in Canada, whose SOC are currently very close to equilibrium, will stop being a net source of CO2 and will become a sink by the year 2000. Rates of carbon change for the years 1970, 1990, and 2010 were estimated to be ±67, ± 39, and 11 kgC ha±1. The rate of decline in the carbon content of agricultural soils in Canada has slowed considerably in the 1990s as a result of an increase in the adoption of no-tillage management, a reduction in the use of summer fallowing, and an increase in fertilizer application. We estimate that the proportion of agricultural land storing SOC will have increased from 17\% in 1990 to 53\% by the year 2000.},

  abstract = {One of the main options for carbon mitigation identified by the IPCC is the sequestration of carbon in soils. In this paper we use statistical relationships derived from European long-term experiments to explore the potential for carbon sequestration in soils in the European Union. We examine five scenarios, namely (a) the amendment of arable soils with animal manure, (b) the amendment of arable soils with sewage sludge, (c) the incorporation of cereal straw into the soils in which it was grown, (d) the afforestation of surplus arable land through natural woodland regeneration, and (e) extensification of agriculture through ley-arable farming. Our calculations suggest only limited potential to increase soil carbon stocks over the next century by addition of animal manure, sewage sludge or straw (c 15 Tg C y-'), but greater potential through extensification of agriculture (z40 Tg C y-') or through the afforestation of surplus arable land (= 50 Tg C y-'). We estimate that extensification could increase the total soil carbon stock of the European Union by 17\%. Afforestation of 30\% of present arable land would increase soil carbon stocks by about 8\% over a century and would substitute up to 30 Tg C y-' of fossil fuel carbon if the wood were used as biofuel. However, even the afforestation scenario, with the greatest potential for carbon mitigation, can sequester only 0.8\% of annual global anthropogenic COp-carbon. Our figures suggest that, although efforts in temperate agriculture can contribute to global carbon mitigation, the potential is small compared to that available through reducing anthropogenic C 0 2 emissions by halting tropical and sub-tropical deforestation or by reducing fossil fuel burning.},

The analysis was carried out on 180 Soil Landscapes of Canada (SLC) polygons, representing 15\% of the SLC polygons within agricultural regions. The analysis was stratified into soil zones and into soil textural classes. For each sampled polygon, Century was run for 1 to 5 types of crop rotations under conventional-tillage as well as no-tillage, providing that no-till was used on at least 5\% of the land. From the Century simulations, it was estimated that the overall rate of SOC loss from agricultural soils in Canada for 1990 was Compared 39.1 kg ha–1 to 1990, the yr–1.

The lower loss in 1990 was primarily due to the incorporation of no-till practices and reduction of summer fallow in the mid 1980s. In 1990, at the provincial level, Alberta had the highest rate of SOC loss at 74.5 kg ha–1 yr–1 followed by Manitoba with 66.1 kg ha–1 yr–1. In Ontario, Quebec, and the Atlantic Provinces the average provincial rate of SOC loss was less than 35 kg ha–1 yr–1. Higher SOC loss rates were typically found in soils with coarser texture and greater native SOC content.},

  abstract = {Soil carbon sequestration could meet at most about one-third of the current yearly increase in atmospheric CO2-carbon, but the duration of the effect would be limited, with signi®cant impacts lasting only 20±50 years. Coupled with this limited duration, increases in population and per-capita energy demand mean that soil carbon sequestration could play only a minor role in closing the difference between predicted and target carbon emissions by 2100. However, if atmospheric CO2 concentrations are to be stabilized at reasonable levels (450±650 ppm), drastic reductions in carbon emissions will be required over the next 20±30 years. Given this, carbon sequestration should form a central role in any portfolio of measures to reduce atmospheric CO2 concentrations over this crucial period, while new energy technologies are developed and implemented. International agreements, such as the Kyoto Protocol, encourage soil carbon sequestration and could be used to formulate soil carbon sequestration polices. Such policies need to take account of other environmental impacts as well as political, economic and societal needs, so that they form part of a raft of measures encouraging sustainable development. Of the carbon sequestration options available, those of a `win±win' nature, that is, those that increase carbon stocks at the same time as improving other aspects of the environment, and those that protect or enhance existing stocks (`no regrets' implementation) show the greatest promise in meeting these goals.},

  abstract = {The effects of long-term annual applications of cattle (Bos taunts) feedlot manure on the accumulation, decomposition (amounts and rates), and movement of organic matter (OM) and Kjeldahl-determined N (total N) in soil were determined. Manure was applied annually since 1973 at three different levels to nonirrigated and irrigated Dark Brown Chernozemic (Typic Haploborolls) clay loam soil. Significant increases in soil OM and total N content in the first 8 and 6 yr, respectively, as affected by the level of manure application, were limited to the surface 30 cm of soil of the nonirrigated and irrigated land. Tillage did not affect the amount of OM and total N accumulated in the soil, but it did affect their distribution within the 0 to 30-cm depth, which is attributed to placement during incorporation. The accumulation of OM and total N were similar under nonirrigated and irrigated conditions. Manure (C/N ratio of ca. 10.2) lowered the C/N ratio of the soil (ca. 8.2) by small amounts. The accumulation of OM and total N was described by a MichaelisMenten type of function. A response surface was generated for the accumulation of OM and total N with increasing levels and years of manure application, from which the rates of accumulation and decomposition were derived. The rates of accumulation decrease with years of application such that after two or three decades increases will be small. The model can be used to develop general guidelines for use and disposal of feedlot manure under similar conditions.},

  abstract = {The composition of animal manure is influenced by the diet fed. Efforts are made to decrease nitrogen emission from pig production by optimizing diet composition. This normally results in a lower proportion of N excreted in urine relative to faeces, and may also influence the turnover and utilization of manure N after field application. The effects of pig feed composition on the excretion of urinary and faecal N, on the dynamics of manure N in soil and on the potential utilization of manure N in the field was studied. Growing pigs and sows were fed 12 different diets with variable contents of fibre and protein (with or without synthetic amino acids). Slurries consisting of a mixture of faeces and urine were stored according to common agricultural practice in Northern Europe. The plant availability of N in the resultant slurries originating from animals fed known diets was tested in small field plots with barley, under conditions with minimal N losses. Separate plots were fertilized with increasing amounts of mineral N. Nitrogen uptake in barley was determined and the utilization of slurry N was compared with that of mineral fertilizer N. The net release of mineral N and C from the slurries in soil was also measured in a parallel incubation study.},

  abstract = {The influence of dairy cattle feed composition on the manure composition and on the dynamics and plant availability of cattle slurry N was studied. Dairy cows were fed seven different forages either with or without supplemental concentrates. The concentration of N in faeces dry matter varied from 18 to 38 g/kg dry matter and increased with increasing digestibility of the feed. Cattle slurries consisting of a mixture of 0.5 faecal N and 0.5 urinary N were stored according to common agricultural practice in Northern Europe. The mineralization of faecal N during slurry storage was very variable (0.09–0.50). The plant availability of N in the slurries originating from cattle fed with known diets was tested in small, framed field plots with spring barley, under conditions with minimal N losses. The nitrogen uptake in barley was determined and the mineral fertilizer equivalent (MFE) of slurry N was calculated. The net release of mineral N and CO2 from the slurries in soil was also measured in a parallel incubation study. The MFE of cattle slurry N varied from 53 to 75 \%. After correcting for the measured urine-N/faeces-N ratio and expected ammonia emission, the MFE varied from 51 to 78 \%. The plant availability and net release of cattle slurry N were influenced by forage type and feeding level. The MFE was negatively correlated with the concentration of crude fibre and neutral detergent fibre (NDF) in the diet, and positively correlated with the dietary protein content. The net release of CO2 from the slurries after 12 weeks in soil was significantly influenced by the concentration of crude fibre in the diet. The plant availability of slurry N was significantly correlated with the ammonium content (R2=0.53) and negatively correlated with the slurry C :N ratio (R2=0.67) and the dry matter : N ratio (R2=0.58). Residual slurry N left in the soil after harvest of the first crop varied from 0.25 to 0.47 of total slurry N. It is concluded that the fibre and the protein content of cattle diets have a significant influence on the plant availability of cattle slurry N and on the amount of residual slurry N remaining in the soil after the first growing season.},

  abstract = {On the North China Plain, low soil organic carbon (SOC) content and a consistently dropping underground water level are seriously threatening food production security. To date, the interactive effect of fertilization types and irrigation regimes on surface and subsurface SOC contents has rarely been quantified. Here, we conducted a field study of three irrigation regimes with two fertilization types between 2009 and 2018. The three irrigation re­ gimes included presowing irrigation (W0); presowing and jointing irrigation (W1); and presowing, jointing and anthesis irrigation (W2). The two fertilization types were mineral fertilizer only (CF) and mineral fertilizer plus composted chicken manure (CFM). Soil samples were collected from a depth of 0− 100 cm in 20-cm increments to measure SOC and its composition, including labile pool I (LPI) (polysaccharides), labile pool II (LPII) (cel­ lulose), and recalcitrant pool (RCP). Four SOC-related enzymes were determined, i.e., α-glucosidase, β-glucosi­ dase, peroxidase and polyphenol oxidase. Stable carbon isotopic (13C) analysis was determined to distinguish the contributions of wheat- and maize-derived SOC in a wheat-maize rotation. The results showed that the 0− 20-cm SOC content was highest in the W0 + CFM treatment. In the 0− 20-cm layer, SOC decreased from W2 to W1 or W0 under CF, which is attributed to a reduction in the labile pool and maize-derived C and higher polyphenol oxidase. Conversely, under CFM, the 0− 20-cm SOC content increased following decreased irrigation from W2 to W1 and from W1 to W0, mainly due to the increased LPII and RCP. Compared with CF at W0 and W1, the 0− 20cm SOC content increased by 30.5 \% and 21.8 \% under CFM, respectively. Relative to the 0− 20-cm soil layer, the SOC stock was larger in the 20− 100-cm layer, which of the treatments had a variation manner similar to the 0− 20-cm soil layer. Our results suggest that reduced irrigation regimes have significantly reduced the SOC stock and altered its composition in the 0− 100-cm soil layer under CF and that CFM can increase the SOC stock in this layer when reducing the irrigation regime.},

A dialyzer was used to remove these interferences and reduce the sensitivity of the method to attain the optimum range in concentration for the simultaneous determination of nitrate, nitrite and ammonium at an analysis rate of 100 samples per hour. Highly coloured plant extracts were also analysed without interference. Ammonium is determined by the Berthelot Reaction, through the formation of a blue coloured compound apparently related to indophenol from the reaction of ammonium and sodium phenoxide, followed by the addition of sodium hypochlorite. Sodium nitroprusside is added to intensify the blue colour. Nitrate is reduced to nitrite at pH 7.5 in a copper-cadmium reductor coil. The nitrite produced reacts under acidic conditions with sulfanilamide to form a diazo compound that couples with N-1-Naphthylethylenediamine dihydrochloride to form a reddish-purple azo dye measurable at 520 nm.},

  abstract = {Animal manure and plant biomass are increasingly used for methane production. While minerals may be conserved during gas generation, the composition of the biogenic material is changed and less carbon (C) is returned to the soil in the digested residue. We evaluated the fate of C in ruminant feed treated differently before added to soil: no treatment (feed), anaerobic digestion (digested feed), consumed by cattle (faeces), consumed by cattle and anaerobic digestion (digested faeces). The materials were incubated for 245 days at 20  C. The net CO2 release was determined and fitted to a kinetic C model (pool half-lives: 4, 20 and 100 days). During anaerobic digestion, gaseous C losses were 80 and 46\% of the C in feed and faeces, respectively. The model predicted that 14, 58, 48, and 76\% of the C applied in feed, digested feed, faeces and digested faeces are retained in soil after 1 to 2 years. When C lost during the pre-treatments was included, the long-term C retention in soil accounted for 12e14\% of the C initially present in the feed. We conclude that soil microbial activity is reduced when residues are anaerobically digested for biogas before being applied to soil. However, the retention in soil of C over decades to centuries appears to be similar whether the initial turnover of plant biomasses occurs in the soil, in the digestive tract of ruminants, in an anaerobic reactor or in a combination of the latter two.},

  abstract = {Three animal manures cross-labelled with               15               N in either the urine, faeces or straw fractions were  prepared. After a storage period of 86 days when the manures were exposed to either composting or  to anaerobic storage, portions of the manures were incubated in six differently textured soils with clay  contents ranging from 11 to 45\%. Evolved CO               2               -C was determined during a 266 day incubation and  inorganic N and               15               N in soil were measured at the termination of the incubation. The mineralization  of C was analysed using first-order kinetics, and two C pools with fast (P               1               ) and slow (P               2               ) turnover  rates were estimated. The total conversion of added C (P               s               ) was estimated as P               s               =P               1               +P               2               .                                         The cumulated CO               2               production was considerably higher from soils incubated with anaerobically  stored manure compared with soils amended with composted manure. CO               2               production levelled off  after               c               . 60 days in the three sandier soils whereas CO               2               continued to be produced throughout the  incubation from the three soils with the highest clay content. More C was assigned to the easily  decomposable P               1               pool in the sandiest soils whereas the more recalcitrant P               2               pool was larger in the soils  with higher clay content. Because of the different relationships between soil texture and C pools, P               s               ended up being similar for five of the six soils. When taking C losses during the preceding storage into  account, the accumulated C losses during storage and after incubation in soil accounted for 60 and  54\% of C initially present in the composted and anaerobically stored manure, respectively.                          Net N mineralization which averaged 16\% of applied organic N took place in all soils amended  with composted manure. Soils with anaerobically stored manure showed net immobilization after the  266 days of incubation. The amount of N immobilized accounted for up to 30\% of the inorganic N  applied with the manure. As anaerobically stored manure generally loses less inorganic N during  storage, it may contain more inorganic N than composted manure at the time of field application.  Because of the immobilization that takes place after application of anaerobically stored manure to  soil, the immediate levels of plant available N in soil may not be as different from soil supplied with  composted manure as could be expected from the inorganic N content in the two types of manure.  However, when considering the manure as a N resource, anaerobic storage is superior to composting.},

  abstract = {Continuous cropping under plastic greenhouses, a common practice in intensive Chinese vegetable production systems, has led to the decline of soil productivity and crop yields. A 4-year greenhouse experiment on cucumber double-cropping systems was conducted in Changping country, Beijing, China, to investigate the effects of summer cover crops and residue management on soil microbial biomass carbon (MBC), C mineralization and cucumber yield. The treatments included sweet corn with residue removal after harvest (SR), sweet corn with residue incorporation after harvest (SI), common bean with residue removal after harvest (CR), common bean with residue incorporation after harvest (CI), Garland chrysanthemum and edible amaranth as summer cover crops (GR), and bare fallow during the summer period (Control). The experiment was a randomized complete block design with three replicates. C mineralization was analyzed by trapping the respired CO2 using air-tight Mason jars containing NaOH vials. After 4 years of the trial, the treatments SR, SI and GR showed significantly (P {$<$} 0.05) higher levels of potentially mineralized readily available carbon, Ca (␮g CO2-C g−1), than control. The Ca values for residue retention treatments were significantly related to the biomass inputs for both sweet corn(r = 0.981; P {$<$} 0.01) and common bean-related (r = 0.994; P {$<$} 0.01) treatments. Generally, the SI and GR treatments showed greater cumulative C mineralization (CCM) than the other treatments. The relatively low CCM:MBC observed for the SI and GR treatments were significantly (P {$<$} 0.05) related to increased cucumber fruit yields from 2005 to 2008. On the contrary, the CR and CI treatments resulted in significant declines in cucumber fruit yields over the same time periods. The responses of cucumber yields to cover crop treatments were related to the dynamics of soil C. These results suggested that the treatments SI and GR could increase C sequestration and improve soil productivity. Further research is required to test how much loss of C (SOC) occurs from the soil due to the protected cultivation using the in situ testing method.},

  abstract = {Hoop manure (a mixture of partially decomposed pig manure and cornstalks from swine fed in hoop structures) was the subject of a nitrogen mass balance during the feeding period. The manure was then composted in windrows to investigate C, nutrient, and mass loss during the composting process. Feeding cycle mass balance results indicated that N losses from the bedded pack ranged from 24 to 36\%. Composting treatments included construction with and without a manure spreader and subsequent management with and without turning. Significantly greater losses of mass, C, K, and Na were found in the turned windrow treatment. However, composting in turned windrows proceeded at a much faster rate, with temperatures dropping out of the thermophilic range within 21 days. Composting without turning was less rapid, with temperatures remaining in the thermophilic range to the end of the 42-day trial. Mass reduction and C loss was significantly higher in the turned windrows than in the unturned windrows. Nitrogen loss was between 37 and 60\% of the initial N, with no significant effect from turning. It appears that the low initial C:N ratio (between 9:1 and 12:1) was the most critical factor affecting the N loss in this composting process. Phosphorus, K, and Na losses were also high during composting, which could be due to runoff and leaching from the hoop manure. These elements may be significant contributors to surface and groundwater pollution through runoff and leaching. Additional research is planned to understand the extent of losses through volatilization, runoff, and leaching during composting.},

  abstract = {S . M . T I Q U I A . 2005. Aims: The objectives of this study were to determine the changes of microbial properties of pig manure collected from pens with different management strategies and composted using different turning and moisture regimes; relate their association with humification parameters and compost temperature; and identify the most suitable microbial indicators of compost maturity. Methods and Results: Six different microbial parameters, including total bacterial count, oxygen consumption rate, ATP content, dehydrogenase activity, and microbial biomass C and N, along with humification parameters [humic acid (HA), fulvic acid (FA) and HA : FA ratio] and compost temperature were monitored during composting. Significant positive correlations were found between temperature and microbial properties, including O2 consumption rate, ATP content, dehydrogenase activity, and microbial biomass N. The humification parameters also showed significant correlations with microbial properties of the manure compost. For instance, HA contents of pig manures was positively correlated with total aerobic heterotrophs, and microbial biomass N and C; and negatively correlated with O2 consumption rate, ATP content, and dehydrogenase activity. Among the six microbial parameters examined, dehydrogenase activity was the most important factor affecting compost temperature and humification parameters. Composting strategies employed in this study affected the speed of composting and time of maturation. If the moisture content is maintained weekly at 60\% with a 4-day turning frequency, the pig manure will reach maturity in 56 days. Conclusions: The composting process went through predictable changes in temperature, microbial properties and chemical components despite differences in the initial pig manure and composting strategies used. Among the six microbial parameters used, dehydrogenase activity is the most suitable indicator of compost maturity. Compared with respiration rate, ATP content and microbial biomass procedures, dehydrogenase activity is the simplest, quickest, and cheapest method that can be used to monitor the stability and maturity of composts. Significance and Impact of the Study: The results presented here show that microbial parameters can be used in revealing differences between composts and compost maturity. The statistical relationship established between humification parameters and microbial parameters, particularly dehydrogenase activity, demonstrates that it is possible to monitor the composting process more easily and rapidly by avoiding longer and more expensive analytical procedures.},

  abstract = {Soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration in agricultural soils requires appropriate cropping systems and conservation practices that increase crop biomass production. No tillage agriculture provides several advantages to establish “carbon friendly” production systems. Conservation agriculture has greatly expanded over the past three decades in the North Central region of Rio Grande de Sul, the southernmost state of Brazil, with about 6 million ha of land under dryland grain crop agriculture. A shift from intensive conventional tillage to mulch tillage and then no tillage has resulted in increased SOC levels across much of the region as verified in field measurements. In this study a modeling system was constructed by coupling the interactive Century (i\_Century) software running Century 4.0 and ArcGIS data layers to simulate the long-term SOC trends in the Ibirubá region, which occupies a land area of 83,500 ha. This system was capable of accounting for cropping system and management practices trends from 1900 to the present times, as well as simulating projections out to the year 2050, capturing periods of decreasing or increasing SOC trends. Simulations performed with the modeling system show that SOC stocks in Ibirubá, estimated at 5.05 Tg C before human activity, decreased to 3.71 Tg C (31\%) by 1985. An estimated recovery to 3.97 Tg C by 2005 in response to adoption of SOC-enhancing practices such as conservation tillage and no tillage was observed. Simulations to 2050 with maintenance of these cropping systems and soil management showed that total C stocks could reach 4.21 Tg C, which would still be 21\% less than originally present in those soils. The integration of Century with GIS was greatly expedited with the use of the i\_Century interface and its readily-accessible database format. Data transfer between the modeling and geoprocessing environment was facilitated for quick visualization and further processing. This approach can be applied for carbon monitoring and accounting schemes at several scales, from the field to the national level.},

  abstract = {Composting is nowadays a general treatment method for municipal solid waste. Compostable household waste contains, together with vegetable material, varying amounts of papers and boards. In the European Union composting is regarded as one recycling method for packages and this will probably favour compostable packages, like papers and boards, in the future. Paper is made up of lignocellulose and it may contain up to 20\% of lignin. Ecient degradation of papers in composting plants means that biodegradation of lignin is also needed. However, very little is known about lignin degradation by mixed microbial compost populations, although lignin degradation by white-rot fungi has been extensively studied in recent years. Organic material is converted to carbon dioxide, humus, and heat by compost microorganisms. It is assumed that humus is formed mainly from lignin. Thus, lignin is not totally mineralized during composting. The elevated temperatures found during the thermophilic phase are essential for rapid degradation of lignocellulose. Complex organic compounds like lignin are mainly degraded by thermophilic microfungi and actinomycetes. The optimum temperature for thermophilic fungi is 40±50°C which is also the optimum temperature for lignin degradation in compost. Ó 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Soil Sci. 83: 363–380. To fulfill commitments under the Kyoto Protocol, Canada is required to provide verifiable estimates and uncertainties for soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks, and for changes in those stocks over time. Estimates and uncertainties for agricultural soils can be derived from long-term studies that have measured differences in SOC between different management practices. We compiled published data from long-term studies in Canada to assess the effect of agricultural management on SOC. A total of 62 studies were compiled, in which the difference in SOC was determined for conversion from native land to cropland, and for different tillage, crop rotation and fertilizer management practices. There was a loss of 24 ± 6\% of the SOC after native land was converted to agricultural land. No-till (NT) increased the storage of SOC in western Canada by 2.9 ± 1.3 Mg ha–1; however, in eastern Canada conversion to NT did not increase SOC. In general, the potential to store SOC when NT was adopted decreased with increasing background levels of SOC. Using no-tillage, reducing summer fallow, including hay in rotation with wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), plowing green manures into the soil, and applying N and organic fertilizers were the practices that tended to show the most consistent increases in SOC storage. By relating treatment SOC levels to those in the control treatments, SOC stock change factors and their levels of uncertainty were derived for use in empirical models, such as the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Guidelines model for C stock changes. However, we must be careful when attempting to extrapolate research plot data to farmers’ fields since the history of soil and crop management has a significant influence on existing and future SOC stocks.},

Soil carbon change factors for the Canadian agriculture national greenhouse gas inventory. Can. J. Soil Sci. 88: 671Á680. Canada annually reports on all of its annual greenhouse gas emissions to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), including estimates of CO2 emissions and removals from cropland management. Soil carbon (C) change in cropland resulting from management is estimated by using C change factors multiplied by the area of cropland subjected to a management change. In this paper we compare soil C change factors in Canadian cropland obtained using a C modelling approach (Century model) to both empirical estimates obtained from the scientific literature, and to default Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) estimates. Factors were estimated for land management changes from annual to perennial cropping, tillage to no-tillage and from summer fallow to continuous cropping. Empirical data comparing C change between conventional tillage (CT) and no-tillage (NT) were highly variable, but the modelled factors were still within the range derived from the empirical data. Factors for changes from CT to NT varied from 0.06 to 0.16 Mg C ha(1 yr(1 across the country. When considering the change from annual to perennial cropping, the modelled factors ranged from 0.46 to 0.56 Mg C ha(1 yr(1, which is in the range of empirical values, and were slightly greater in the eastern than the western soil regions. For conversion of crop-fallow to continuous cropping, the modelled rate of C storage (0.33 Mg C ha(1 yr(1) was more than double the average rate of 0.1590.06 Mg C ha(1 yr(1 derived from two independent assessments of the literature. For each of the management changes considered, the modelled factors were generally lower than IPCC estimates, and this is partly attributable to differences in calculation methods and to the fact that C changes likely occur more slowly in the cold climate of Canada. Generally, the results show that the modelling approach used at present to derive C change factors for use in Canada’s inventory is adequate. However, soil C change factors for cropland soils in Canada would be greatly improved by a reduction in the high variability usually associated with empirical data, and by improved simulation of the Century model under varying management conditions.},

Unlike empirical work, modelling does not provide direct information on nature, and the goal is generally to explain natural phenomena, or predict their consequences, rather than reveal new phenomena or test speci®c hypotheses. Goals, methods and results of modelling and empirical work thus differ and they should be judged by different criteria. This note shows how the four criteria of explanation, testability, novelty and good modelling practice can be applied to modelling papers in the plant sciences. The practical implementation of these criteria is discussed, and a checklist of eight questions is derived with which papers can be evaluated. To illustrate the use of the criteria, they are applied to a classic publication from the crop modelling literature [Simulation of Assimilation, Respiration and Transpiration of Crops.

However, the quantitative understanding of the relationship between the ration composition and the availability and stability of the various C, N, P and S compounds in the manure is still poor.

However, if major interest is in some quantity averaged over time or space it would be more pertinent to evaluate how well the model predicts this average quantity. We show that the model squared error for predictions averaged over space or time will always be smaller than average squared prediction error and how to estimate the difference between the two, using commonly available data. We illustrate with two case studies concerning irrigation management, (where major interest is in yield averaged over years) and nitrous oxide emissions (where major interest is in emissions averaged over a growing season). Squared error of the average was estimated to be only 57\% and 10\% of the average squared error for the irrigation and nitrous oxide emissions studies, respectively, in the limit of averaging over long times.},

Specifically, whether soil microbial physiology parameters and residual materials are important to soil organic C (SOC) content is still unclear. Here, we explored the effects of biotic and abiotic factors on SOC content based on a survey of soils from 16 locations along a \textasciitilde 4000 km forest transect in eastern China, spanning a wide range of climate, soil conditions, and microbial communities. We found that SOC was highly correlated with soil microbial biomass C (MBC) and amino sugar (AS) concentration, an index of microbial necromass. Microbial C use efficiency (CUE) was significantly related to the variations in SOC along this national-­scale transect. Furthermore, the effect of climatic and edaphic factors on SOC was mainly via their regulation on microbial physiological properties (CUE and MBC). We also found that regression models on explanation of SOC variations with microbial physiological parameters and AS performed better than the models without them. Our results provide the empirical linkages among climate, microbial characteristics, and SOC content at large scale and confirm the necessity of incorporating microbial biomass and necromass pools in ESMs under global change scenarios.},

A well documented, process-based model, DNDC, was employed, depending on the local climate, soil and management conditions in the six regions. Modelled results indicated that, under the present management conditions, the SOC status in the three northern sites (i.e., Qiqihar, Miyun and Pingliang) where upland crops dominated appeared more dynamic than that in the three southern sites (i.e., Zhijiang, Jiangning and Yantin) where paddy rice dominated. During the simulated 20 years, the northern sites were either losing or gaining SOC at relatively high rates from −1000 to 200 kg C/ ha/yr; and the southern sites had relatively stable SOC contents with deviations ranging from −70 to 26 kg C/ ha/yr. Increase in the fraction of above-ground crop residue incorporated in soil or application of manure effectively converted most of the tested sites into sinks of atmospheric carbon. Since crop residue and manure resources are available in most of the agricultural regions, adaptation of the management alternatives should be feasible in China.},

The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of P-based application of various forms of cattle manure (liquid, LCM; or solid, SCM) or inorganic P as triple superphosphate (IP) on soil P losses in tile drainage water. A 4-yr field experiment was conducted in a clay loam soil with a corn (Zea mays L.)–soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] rotation in the Lake Erie basin. Over the 4 yr, the dissolved reactive P (DRP) flow-weighted mean concentration (FWMC) in tile drainage water was greater under SCM fertilization than under either IP or LCM fertilization. Despite its lower value on an annual basis, DRP FWMC rose dramatically immediately after LCM application. However, the differences in DRP FWMC did not result in detectable differences in DRP loads. Regarding particulate P and total P losses during the 4 yr, they were 68 and 47\%, respectively, lower in the soils amended with SCM than in those with IP, whereas both values were similar between IP and LCM treatments. Overall, the P contained in solid cattle manure was less prone to P loss after land application. Accordingly, the present results can provide a basis for manure storage and application of best management practices designed to reduce P losses and improve crop growth.},

The molecular size distribution of DOMs in the three manures was in the range of 1–10 kDa detected by GPC. Microbial carbon utilization capacity decreased in cow manure with composting time, but the contrast was observed in the chicken and swine manures.},

A laboratory incubation experiment was conducted using the soil from a long-term experiment involving the following fertilisation regimes: no fertilisation (CK); mineral (NPK); organic (M), and combined organic-inorganic fertilisers (MNPK). SOC mineralisation rate decreased as follows: MNPK {$>$} M {$>$} NPK {$>$} CK. Cumulative SOC mineralisation (Cm) ranged between 730.15 and 3 022.09 mg/kg in CK and MNPK, respectively; 8.81\% (CK) to 20.45\% (MNPK) of initial SOC was mineralised after a 360-day incubation. Soil Cm values were significantly higher under NPK, M, and MNPK compared to those under the CK treatment. Dynamic variation in Cm with incubation time fitted a double exponential model. Active carbon pools accounted for 2.06–6.51\% of total SOC and the average mean resistant time (MRT1) was 28.76 days, whereas slow carbon pools accounted for 93.49–97.94\% of SOC, with an average MRT2 of 8.53 years. The active carbon pool in fertilised soils was larger than in CK; furthermore, it was larger in M- and MNPK- than under NPK-treated plots. SOC decomposed more easily in long-term fertilised plots than in non-fertilised plots.},

  abstract = {Incubation is a classical laboratory experiment to gain information about the carbon turnover from soils under different treatments (e.g., temperatures, water content, nutrient supply), amendments (e.g. biochar, straw, compost), or from different locations (e.g. topsoil vs. subsoil). Classically, the measured data are represented as cumulated CO2 flux or as \% total organic carbon (TOC) mineralized and from those data kinetic parameters are often derived using models of different complexity. Based on the conceptual idea that more than one C-pool exists, especially in soil mixtures, the simple single-pool model is more and more substituted by double-pool models to describe these data. Hereby, the model will be iteratively fitted to the data to obtain the pool sizes and rate constants of the pools (slow and fast). In the work presented, we show that the fitting of double-pool models will lead to different results in the pool sizes and kinetic parameters, depending on the fitting approach used. Secondly, general problems of over-fitting and the ill-posed problem are discussed, whereby it will be shown, that especially the estimation of the rate constant for the slow pool is highly uncertain. Based on these general findings and problems in the fitting procedure, fitting results reported in literature were analyzed. The metaanalysis indicates that only a small number of reported fits are apparently not well fitted, whereas a nonnegligible percentage of reported fits were over-fitted or wrong parameters were reported. Finally, the paper provides guidelines for kinetic fitting and discusses possible fitting alternatives.},

  abstract = {Crop production on acid soils can be improved greatly by adjusting the pH to near neutrality. While soil acidity is commonly corrected by liming, there is evidence that animal manure amendments can increase the pH of acid soils. The effect of fresh cattle manure on soil acidity and nutrient availability was determined in the laboratory for two acid soils from Beaverlodge and Fort Vermillion in the Peace River region of Alberta, Canada. The effect of manure on soil pH was immediate and persisted during an 8-wk incubation. Manureamended soil had significantly higher pH than unamended soil, and the highest rate (40 g manure kgϪ1, dry weight basis) increased the pH of Beaverlodge and Fort Vermillion soils from 4.8 to 6.0 and 5.5 to 6.3, respectively. The higher pH in manure-amended than unamended soils was attributed to buffering from bicarbonates and organic acids in cattle manure. Mineral N (NH4–N ϩ NO3–N), available P, K, Ca, and Mg increased immediately after manure application, and available P and K remained significantly higher in manure-amended than unamended soil after the 8-wk incubation. Soils amended with 40 g manure kgϪ1 had three to four times more plant-available P and K than unamended soils after incubation. Available S concentrations did not differ significantly in manure-amended and unamended soils. Extractable Al and Fe declined slightly after manure application, but did not differ in manure-amended or unamended soils after incubation. No change in the cation-exchange capacity (CEC) of manureamended soils compared to unamended soils was observed in this study, and it appears that appreciable changes in Al, Fe, and CEC from manure application do not occur in the short-term (weeks). Our results indicate that, in the short-term, cattle manure amendments can increase the pH and the quantity of plant-available P and K in acid soils.},

The objectives of this study were to determine how long term cattle manure applications to a calcareous Haploboroll clay loam (Lethbridge, AB, Canada) affected aggregate size distribution, the total C, N, and P content of aggregate size fractions, and water-stable aggregates. Beef cattle manure applied at rates Ͼ30 Mg haϪ1 yrϪ1 under dryland production and Ͼ60 Mg haϪ1 yrϪ1 to soils under irrigation resulted in fewer dry-sieved aggregates Ͼ7.1 mm and more drysieved aggregates between 0.47 and 1.2 mm in the 0- to 5-cm depth, compared with unamended soils. The dry-sieved aggregate fractions between 0.47 and 1.2 mm include the Ͻ0.84-mm fraction that has been associated with increased susceptibility to wind erosion in the Canadian semiarid prairies. There was more total C, N, and P in all dry-sieved aggregate fractions of soils receiving Ͼ30 Mg manure haϪ1 yrϪ1 than unamended soils, and dry-sieved aggregates between 0.47 and 2.0 mm tended to have the highest C, N, and P contents. Water aggregate stability was higher in irrigated than dryland soils, but did not improve with increasing manure application rates. Dispersing agents in the cattle manure appear to have destabilized the larger soil macroaggregates.},

  abstract = {Straw incorporation is crucial to soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration, thus improving soil fertility and mitigating climate change. The fate of straw C and the associated net SOC balance remain largely unexplored, particularly in soils subjected to long-term mineral and organic fertilization. To address this, soil (δ13C: –19‰) that had been continuously cropped with maize for 31 years and subjected to five long-term fertilization regimes, including (i) control (Unfertilized), (ii) mineral fertilizer (NPK) application, (iii) 200\% NPK (2 × NPK) application, (iv) manure (M) application, and (v) NPK plus manure (NPKM) application, was incubated with or without addition of rice straw (δ13C: –29‰) for 70 days. Straw addition largely primed SOC mineralization. The priming effect (PE) was considerably higher in 2 × NPK (+122\% of CO2 from soil without straw addition) but lower in M (+43\%) relative to the unfertilized soil (+82\%), highlighting the importance of fertilization in controlling PE intensity. Fertilization increased the straw-derived microbial biomass C by 90–577\% and strawderived SOC by 34–68\% compared to the unfertilized soil, primarily due to the increased abundance of Gramnegative bacteria and cellobiohydrolase activity. Straw-derived SOC was strongly positively correlated with straw-derived microbial biomass C, suggesting that dead microbial biomass (necromass) was a dominant precursor of SOC formation. Consequently, fertilization facilitated microbial utilization of straw C and its retention in soil, particularly in the M and NPKM fertilized soils. The amounts of straw-derived SOC overcompensated for the SOC losses by mineralization, resulting in net C sequestration which was highest in the NPK fertilized soil. Our study emphasizes that NPK fertilization decreases the intensity of the PE induced by straw addition and increases straw C incorporation into SOC, thus facilitating C sequestration in agricultural soils.},

Soil carbon and nitrogen dynamics directly affect soil quality, crop productivity and environmental impacts. Root systems are central to the acquisition of water and nutrients by plants, but are also a major pathway for the inputs of carbon and nutrients to soil. The complexity of both biotic and abiotic interactions, combined with stochastic changes in root architecture, makes it difficult to understand below-ground dynamics on the basis of experimentation alone. The integration of dynamic models of above-ground growth, three-dimensional root system demography, and interactions between plants and the environment, into one single model is a major challenge because of the complexity of the systems.},

Results showed that compared to mineral fertilization (0.64\,−\,0.69), the manure amendments significantly increased microbial C use efficiency (CUE) (0.76\,−\,0.79), mainly due to higher soil pH, lower resource stoichiometric ratios of dissolved organic C (DOC): mineral N, DOC: available P and mineral N: available P, and lower specific activities (per microbial biomass C unit) of β-1,4-glucosidase, N-acetyl-glucosaminidase and acid phosphatase. Glucose addition increased SOC mineralization, inducing positive priming effect (PE) with lower values in the manure amendments (0.11\,−\,0.12 mg C ­g−1 SOC) relative to mineral fertilization (0.25\,−\,0.55 mg C g­ −1 SOC). The PE was negatively correlated with soil pH and positively associated with resource stoichiometric ratios of DOC: mineral N, DOC: available P and mineral N: available P, mainly due to microbes mineralizing SOM to release nutrients, as indicated by the positive relationships between PE and the specific activities of N-acetyl-glucosaminidase and acid phosphatase. Concluding, relative to mineral fertilization, long-term manure amendment could increase CUE and decrease PE via alleviated soil acidification and resource limitation, thus facilitating soil C sequestration.},

Wetlands store more C per unit area than any other ecosystem, but SOM storage mechanisms such as aggregation and metal complexes are mostly untested in wetlands. This review discusses what is currently known about the role of microorganisms in SOM formation and C sequestrations, as well as, measures of microbial communities as they relate to wetland C cycling. Studies within the last decade have yielded new insights about microbial communities. For example, microbial communities appear to be adapted to short-term fluctuations in saturation and redox and researchers have observed synergistic pairings that in some cases run counter to thermodynamic theory. Significant knowledge gaps yet to be filled include: (i) What controls microbial access to and decomposition of plant litter and SOM? (ii) How does microbial community structure shape C fate, across different wetland types? (iii) What types of plant and microbial molecules contribute to SOM accumulation? Studies examining the active microbial community directly or that utilize multi-pronged approaches are shedding new light on microbial functional potential, however, and promise to improve wetland C models in the near future.},

  abstract = {Organic fertilizers increase soil organic matter (SOM) stocks, but the underlying processes depend on the fertilizer type and remain largely unknown. To evaluate the predominant C stabilization mechanisms, upland Ultisols subjected to 27 years of mineral and organic fertilization were analyzed for SOM content, aggregate size classes, and amino sugar composition. The long-term field experiment had seven treatments: no fertilization (Control), mineral NPK fertilizers (NPK), NPK plus lime (NPK + Lime), NPK plus peanut straw (NPK + PeanutStraw), NPK plus rice straw (NPK + RiceStraw), NPK plus radish residue (NPK + RadishResidue), and NPK plus pig manure (NPK + PigManure). The 27-year application of mineral fertilizers (NPK and NPK + Lime), NPK + crop residues, and NPK + PigManure increased SOM content by 11.0–13.2\%, 16.3–25.3\%, and 44.3\%, respectively, compared with the Control. The aliphaticity and recalcitrance indices based on 13C nuclear magnetic resonance spectra of organic fertilizers were higher for pig manure than for crop residues. Both indices were closely correlated with SOM content after 27 years, so higher proportions of recalcitrant C in manure facilitated SOM accumulation. NPK + PigManure increased the mass proportion of large macroaggregates 2.9-fold compared with the Control, and reduced the effective diffusion coefficient of oxygen in the soil. Consequently, NPK + PigManure limited the activity and abundance of aerobes and the accessibility of SOM to microorganisms, in turn facilitating SOM accumulation. The application of mineral fertilizers, NPK + crop residues, and NPK + PigManure increased microbial necromass to 2.85–3.03, 3.21–3.45, and 3.62 g C kg−1, respectively, from 2.63 g C kg−1 in the Control. Compared with crop residues, pig manure did not affect bacterial necromass but increased fungal necromass from 2.19 to 2.39 g C kg−1 to 2.58 g C kg−1, which might associate with increased SOM stability. However, the relative contribution of microbial necromass to SOM was lower under NPK + PigManure than under NPK + crop residues, since more added C was protected in the NPK + PigManure soil. Our results suggest that manure may contribute to SOM accumulation and stabilization in three ways: directly through the input of recalcitrant organic C, indirectly through the stabilization of aggregates and physical protection of C, and to a lesser extent through increasing fungal necromass.},

After establishing the baseline soil organic carbon (SOC) content for 1990, a 25-year simulation was run for four management scenarios: A (minimum organic matter application), B (farmyard manure application), C (double cropping for paddy fields) and D (both B and C). The total SOC decreased during the simulation in all four scenarios because the C input in all four scenarios was lower than that required to maintain the baseline 1990 SOC level. Scenario A resulted in the greatest depletion, reflecting the effects of increased organic matter application in the other scenarios. The 25-year difference in SOC accumulation between scenario A and scenarios B, C and D was 32.3, 11.1 and 43.4 Mt C, respectively. The annual SOC accumulation per unit area was similar to a previous estimate, and the 25-year averages were 0.30, 0.10 and 0.41 t C ha)1 year)1 for scenarios B, C and D, respectively. The system we developed in the present study, that is, linking the RothC model and soil spatial data, can be useful for estimating the potential C sequestration resulting from an increase in organic matter input to Japanese arable soils, although more feasible scenarios need to be developed to enable more realistic estimation.},

  abstract = {This article is part of a collection of articles that provides a comprehensive description of hydrologic and water quality (H/WQ) model calibration and validation concepts and processes. Sensitivity analysis (SA), which is often used to quantify the strength of relationships between model inputs and outputs, is an essential evaluation of any kind of modeling. SA is crucial in H/WQ models due to various aspects involved in H/WQ modeling processes, such as empiricism, spatiotemporal scales, and complexity, that require an assessment of parameters’ influence on the model’s prediction. This study synthesized SA applications for 25 H/WQ models in the special collection on model use, calibration, and validation published in 2012 and provides guidance on their future applications. Commonly used SA methods are summarized along with tools to implement them. While SA was not employed for all 25 models in the special collection, a wide range of SA methods (from partial derivatives to variance-based global methods) and sensitivity measures (from scatter plots to variance decomposition measures) were used in the literature. Some model parameters were found to be important in most sensitivity applications performed for the models; however, their relative importance varied from study to study, underscoring the necessity of SA for every new model application. Nevertheless, summarizing important model parameters can still serve as a starting point for model users. Since most studies concentrated on model parameters alone; future SA applications in H/WQ modeling should also consider other inputs (climate data, boundary conditions, etc.) and non-parametric aspects, such as features and processes considered in the model.},

  abstract = {To accurately estimate past terrestrial carbon pools is the key to understanding the global carbon cycle and its relationship with the climate system. SoilGen2 is a useful tool to obtain aspects of soil properties (including carbon content) by simulating soil formation processes; thus it offers an opportunity for both past soil carbon pool reconstruction and future carbon pool prediction. In order to apply it to various environmental conditions, parameters related to carbon cycle process in SoilGen2 are calibrated based on six soil pedons from two typical loess deposition regions (Belgium and China). Sensitivity analysis using the Morris method shows that decomposition rate of humus (kHUM), fraction of incoming plant material as leaf litter (frecto) and decomposition rate of resistant plant material (kRPM) are the three most sensitive parameters that would cause the greatest uncertainty in simulated change of soil organic carbon in both regions. According to the principle of minimizing the difference between simulated and measured organic carbon by comparing quality indices, the suited values of kHUM, frecto and kRPM in the model are deduced step by step and validated for independent soil pedons. The difference of calibrated parameters between Belgium and China may be attributed to their different vegetation types and climate conditions. This calibrated model allows more accurate simulation of carbon change in the whole pedon and has potential for future modeling of carbon cycle over long timescales.},

  abstract = {Legacy phosphorus (P) in agricultural soils has become a predominate source contributing to P loadings to Lake Erie since the mid-90s. The use of legacy P in soils can be an ultimate and effective way to mitigate the risk of agricultural P loss and to circumvent potential P rock reserve shortage, while sustaining crop production. A field experiment was conducted to assess the impacts of P draw-down (PDD) (i.e., use of legacy P in soils) on crop yields, P uptake and removal, and soil test P (Olsen P, an agronomic P calibration and environmental soil P risk indicator in the region) under a corn–soybean rotation in a clay loam soil of the Lake Erie Basin, southwestern Ontario, Canada, from 2008 to 2018. Corn and soybean grain yields with PDD were identical to those with continuous P addition (CPA), averaged at 7.7 Mg ha−1 for corn and 3.7 Mg ha−1 for soybean, over 11 years. Similarly, no significant differences in crop P uptake and removal were found between PDD and CPA. Compared to CPA, PDD increased net farming income by Canadian dollar (CAD) 104–125 ha−1 year−1 (i.e., USD 78.5–94.4 ha−1 year−1), with savings on P fertilizer materials and associated application costs. Soil P loss risks with PDD reduced, as indicated by soil test P that, in the top layer (0–15 cm), decreased linearly with crop production year at 3.27 mg P kg−1 year−1 or 16.2 mg P kg−1 per 100 kg crop P removal per hectare, while in the lower soil layers, 15–90 cm, it remained unchanged. In comparison, CPA of 50 kg P ha−1 sustained soil test P in the entire soil profile, 0–90 cm, over the 11-year period. PDD can be a beneficial management practice utilizing legacy P in soils to achieve both agronomic and economic goals in an environmentally sustainable manner.},

The effects of proportion (5\%, 15\%, 30\%), compost type (sewage sludge (SS), tomato stem waste (TSW), municipal solid waste (MSW), kitchen waste (KW), cabbage waste (CW), peat (P), chicken manure (CM), dairy cattle manure (DCM)) and the black soil (CK). Their initial biochemical composition (carbon, nitrogen, C:N ratio) on carbon (C) mineralization in soil amended compost have been investigated. The CO2-C production of different treatments were measured to indicate the levels of carbon (C) mineralization during 50 d of laboratory incubation. And the one order E model (M1E) was used to quantify C mineralization kinetics. The results demonstrated that the respiration and C mineralization of soil were promoted by amending composts. The C mineralization ability increased when the percentage of compost added to the soil also increased and affected by compost type in the order CM {$>$} KW, CW {$>$} SS, DCM, TSW {$>$} MSW, P {$>$} CK at the same amended level. Based on the values of C0 and k1 from M1E model, a management method in agronomic application of compost products to the precise fertilization was proposed. The SS, DCM and TSW composts were more suitable in supplying fertilizer to the plant. Otherwise, The P and MSW composts can serve the purpose of long-term nutrient retention, whereas the CW and KW composts could be used as soil remediation agent.},

  abstract = {Field experimental data of maize and soybean from two locations in the US Corn Belt and winter wheat in northern Oklahoma were used to develop a modified empirical method for simulating green leaf area index (GLAI) in the DayCent model. The method is based on the change of green leaf weight ratio (GLWR) as a function of phasic development in grain crops, in which GLWR decreases as growing degree days increase. In the previous version of DayCent, GLWR was assumed constant for annual crops and GLAI increased proportional to above-ground biomass from post-emergence until reaching full canopy and was then assumed to remain constant until harvest. The simulated results from the modified DayCent model compared well with field measurement of GLAI and aboveground biomass for all three crops (avg. R2 of approximately 0.8). The new GLAI algorithm yielded a substantial improvement in simulated canopy dynamics as well as evapotranspiration and soil–water content, especially in late growing season period, with the improved representation of canopy senescence. The overall R2 for canopy cover improved from 0.66 to 0.93 for maize and 0.52 to 0.88 for soybean; the R2 for weekly ET in late growing season increased from 0.53 to 0.82 for the Nebraska site. Simulation of biomass and grain yield by the modified model was also improved relative to the prior DayCent version for maize (R2 increased from 0.47 to 0.69).},

  abstract = {Changes in field management and climate will alter soil organic carbon (SOC) and nitrogen (SN) cycling in the coming decades. This study is to quantify the effects of various fertilisation strategies and climate change scenarios on crop yield, and soil C and N cycling by the end of this century. Data from a long-term experiment with a winterwheat (Triticum aestivium L.) and summer maize (Zea mays L.) rotation in Northern China was used to calibrate and validate the SPACSYS model. Five fertiliser practices were used: control (CK); combined mineral nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium (NPK); NPK plus manure (NPKM); high application rate of NPK fertilisers plus manure (hNPKM) and NPK with straw incorporation (NPKS). Crop yields, and SOC and SN stocks by 2100 were predicted under four climate scenarios (Baseline, RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP4.5). Results showed that the SPACSYS model can adequately simulate the dynamics of SOC and SN stocks and the yields of winter wheat and summer maize. An application of NPK plus manure or straw not only enhanced crop yield, but also substantially increased SOC and SN stocks. The predictions showed the positive effects of fertilisation and climate change on crop yields and SOC stocks compared with those under the baseline. However, SN stock under the RCP8.5 decreased by 3–14\% by 2100 for various fertilisation strategies compared with that under the baseline. On the other hand, mineral fertiliser plus manure led to a higher soil respiration rate and nitrogen losses through leaching and surface runoff under all the climate scenarios. Therefore, application of mineral fertilisers plus manure could enhance crop productivity and sustain soil fertility but cause more carbon emitted to the atmosphere and nitrogen losses. More attention should be paid on optimising fertilisation in order to increase crop productivity while minimising environmental risks.},

  abstract = {Soil organic carbon content has a significant impact on soil fertility and grain yield, making it an important factor affecting agricultural production and food security. Dry farmland, the main type of cropland in China, has a lower soil organic carbon content than that of paddy soil, and it may have a significant carbon sequestration potential. Therefore, in this study we applied the CENTURY model to explore the temporal and spatial changes of soil organic carbon (SOC) in Jilin Province from 1985 to 2015. Dry farmland soil polygons were extracted from soil and land use layers (at the 1:1,000,000 scale). Spatial overlay analysis was also used to extract 1282 soil polygons from dry farmland. Modelled results for SOC dynamics in the dry farmland, in conjunction with those from the Yushu field-validation site, indicated a good level of performance. From 1985 to 2015, soil organic carbon density (SOCD) of dry farmland decreased from 34.36 Mg C ha−1 to 33.50 Mg C ha−1 in general, having a rate of deterioration of 0.03 Mg C ha−1 per year. Also, SOC loss was 4.89 Tg from dry farmland soils in the province, with a deterioration rate of 0.16 Tg C per year. 35.96\% of the dry farmland its SOCD increased but 64.04\% of the area released carbon. Moreover, SOC dynamics recorded significant differences between different soil groups. The method of coupling the CENTURY model with a detailed soil database can simulate temporal and spatial variations of SOC at a regional scale, and it can be used as a precise simulation method for dry farmland SOC dynamics.},

  abstract = {Despite numerous investigations of the maturation process of composts, a simple and straightforward parameter which can predict plant response upon compost application has yet to be defined. In light of results accumulated over a decade, we examined simple, chemical parameters of three composts from three types of source materials (municipal solid waste (MSW), separated cow manure (CSM), biosolids (BS)). These materials were composted using different procedures and facilities. The chemical parameters were correlated to the growth response of cucumbers or ryegrass sown in potting media amended with the composts sampled at different stages of the process. The dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration of all composts decreased rapidly within the first month, then, towards the end of the process, stabilized at concentration below 4 g kgK1. DOC correlated highly and significantly to the absorbance at 465 nm in all composts, and also to the C/N ratio. Nitrate evolution was similar in all composts, but the final concentrations differed among them. Plant biomass increased with composting time. For CSM and BS compost maximum biomass was reached when the DOC reached levels below 4 g kgK1. DOC concentration is suggested for use as a simple method of determining maturity, with 4 g kgK1 recommended as a threshold level indicating maturity. Absorbance at 465 nm can be used instead of DOC concentration after appropriate calibration.},
